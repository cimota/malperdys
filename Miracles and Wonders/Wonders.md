*”The most incredible thing about miracles is that they happen."* - G.K. Chesterton.

Where [[Technology and Reality|Technology]] builds upon the known rules of the universe to create wonders, Wonders are built upon the unknown rules of the universe and, in some cases, the rules of adjacent universes (See [[Darkness]]. Wonders allow for the inexplicable and the unforeseen remembering that the skein of everything within a universe (the fundamental information layer) describes everything within a universe, including everything that is, has been or could be. 

*“Miracles are not the suspension of natural laws, but the revelation of truths too vast for our understanding to contain.”* – Moriac Sorla O Vaelin, The High Council of the Infinite O.

Some wonders might include

The [[Penance Configuration]]
The [[Thern diadem]]
[[The Chalk of Timur]]
