Ontonic objects are not simply technology, they may be considered [[Magic|magical]], but also might be [[Wonders]]. They arise when there is a significant chiasmatic event between two or more realities.

Some Ontonic Objects have sufficient [[Darkness]] imbued that they may cross the [[Shift]] and appear in multiple realities. 
- [[Excalibur|The Sword]]
- [[The Necronomicon|The Book]]
- [[Siege Perilous|The Crown]]
- [[The Cup]]
- [[The Coin]]
- [[The Stave]]
- [[The Silent Bell|The Bell]]
Individual objects can be powerful or seem relatively minor. However, new abilities of immense magnitude and unpredictability can be unlocked when one or more of these objects are brought into proximity. 

> [!List]- Sample Ontonic Objects
> 1.  [[Null Coin]] – A coin that, when flipped, never lands but remains in a state of endless motion until observed.
> 2. [[The Whispering Lens]] – A cracked monocle that reveals glimpses of alternate realities but whispers in unknown languages when worn.
> 3. [[The Folding Key]] – A key that changes its shape to fit any lock, but each use alters the reality behind the door.
> 4. [[The Paradox Hourglass]] – Flipping it can rewind time, but only for events you don’t remember happening.
> 5. [[The Hunger Fork]] – A tarnished silver fork that makes food vanish when touched but leaves the eater feeling full.
> 6. [[The Orphaned Glove]] – A single black glove that, when worn, makes the other hand appear elsewhere in the multiverse.
> 7. [[The Impossible Map]] – A map showing a place that doesn’t exist—until you try to visit it.
> 8. [[The Stolen Watch]] – A pocket watch that runs backward, and if worn too long, it erases you from the memories of those around you.
> 9. [[The Unlit Match]] – Striking it causes light to vanish from the room instead of igniting.
> 10. [[The Recursion Mirror]] – A small hand mirror that shows not your reflection, but what you would be in another reality.
> 11. [[The Borrowed Pen]] – Anything written with it appears in a different universe instead of on paper.
> 12. [[The Mnemonic Feather]] – A crow’s feather that, when held, allows you to recall memories that aren’t your own.
> 13. [[The False Compass]] – Always points toward the place you least expect to be.
> 14. [[The Silent Bell]] – A brass bell that, when rung, causes sound to vanish in a 10-meter radius for exactly 42 seconds.
> 15. [[The Unfinished Puzzle]] – A wooden puzzle with missing pieces—anyone who tries to complete it risks becoming one of the missing pieces.
> 16. [[The Last Candle]] – Can be lit infinite times, but each time it burns, someone somewhere forgets your existence for an hour.
> 17. [[The Forgotten Ticket]] – A transit ticket to an unknown destination; attempting to use it summons a vehicle that does not belong to this world.
> 18. [[The Endless Scarab]] – A small golden beetle that, once lost, always returns to you… but slightly different each time.
> 19. [[The Hollow Dice]] – Rolling them lets you re-roll fate, but at a cost you won’t understand until later.
> 20. [[The Unfinished Letter]] – A page of handwritten text in a language you almost—but don’t quite—understand. The more you read, the more real it becomes.

# Ontonic Items within the Malperdys House

Possession of any of these Items will identify the holder as a member of a [[Malperdys]] [[Malperdys#Households|Household]]. Some of the items have innate powers whereas others can only be revealed through interactions.

> [!List]- The Most Common Items
> - The Key Without Teeth – Smooth, brass, utterly useless in any lock — unless near another Household item, when it grows jagged ridges which mould themselves to any lock.
> - The Compact Mirror  – Ornately carved from red jade-like stone and enclosing a perfect mirror. When used with the Hairbrush, it can see into other worlds.
> - The Hairbrush – Looks ordinary, with the bristles worn down but strands of unfamiliar hair are always caught in it. If used to brush hair within the House, it invites visions of loved ones wherever they are.
> - The Teacup – Slightly cracked, yet never spills when filled. When another Ontonic Item rests inside it, the crack glows faintly.
> - The Broken Spectacle Lens – Just one lens, its wire bent. When rubbed with the Handkerchief, it glows with unearthly light.
> - The Silver Spoon – Tarnished black, yet polished smooth at the tip. Stirring liquid with it increases the temperature to that of hot tea.
> - The Handkerchief – Worn thin from use, but nothing can pass through it. Not light or bullets. 
> - The Weathered Notebook – Its pages are blank, but when two other Items are set upon it, faint impressions of words appear between them which reveal something relevant to the reader.
> - The Candle Stub – Never grows shorter when burned. If lit beside the Teacup or Spectacle Lens, the flame light reveals the unseen.
> - The Faded Scarf – Ordinary wool, patched and frayed, around 1.5 metres in length. If wrapped around someone in the presence of the Spoon, it doubles healing rate.
> - The Pipe - normally found in the Drawing Room, this is an ornate carved pipe, made from human bone. If used to smoke tobacco, it causes the smoker to be possessed by an Malperdys antecedent. The possession ends when the pipe is cleaned using the Handkerchief.
> - the Pianoforte -  an original made by Bartolomeo Cristofori in 1700AD. Playing the instrument removes violent urges from anyone who can hear it.
