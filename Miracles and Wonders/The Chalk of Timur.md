The Chalk appears like a small fragment of red chalk (Sanguina) rock, roughly shaped into a squat cylinder.
## Properties
Anything written by the chalk becomes an [[Reality Meme (Onton)|Onton]]. It will have immediate effects within the current [[Brane]] and will also have [[Darkness]]-related effects on adjacent branes. In the presence of no Brane, it can generate one from nothing; creating a pocket universe with minimal laws drawn from the Ontons of the person writing it.
## Origin
The Chalk is an [[Irisian]] artifact. The anchor in the perceptible world is a piece of chalk, however this hides immense complexity in the form of a reality-altering engine located in the [[Shift]]. Anyone with enhanced perceptions may notice that this simple item has an immensely complex weave of reality around it. Most [[Irisian|Irisians]] will become very interested in the item, a legacy of their former grandeur. 
## Location
The Chalk is currently in the pocket of a tweed jacket owned by Jeff Saunders, a Civics teacher in Banks High School in Banks, Oregon.
