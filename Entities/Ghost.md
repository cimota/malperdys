Ghosts are (most likely) the [[Reality Meme (Onton)|Onton]]ic residue of a living person or entity after that individual has died. This represents a transitional information-layer state before the raw data is re-released into the mathematical base layer of the reality.

Most Ghosts are limited to their own [[Brane|reality]] but those with sufficient [[Darkness]] may be able to manifest in semantically-adjacent [[Brane]]s.
