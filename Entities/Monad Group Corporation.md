The Monad Group Corporation is an extradimensional meme virus not dissimilar to the [[Carcosa|Carcosan]] [[Reality Meme (Onton)|Infestation]], with one significant difference; its manifestation is one of capitalism and therefore it is easy to blend into current-era Earth.

The [[Board]] of the Monad Group Corporation are believed to be incorporeal entities who seek to amass more control, more possessions, more wealth and more territory with insatiable zeal. For them, there will never be enough; they will acquire and devour everything they encounter.

They are a [Von Neumann Replicating Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft) that will stop at nothing to expand.

Once they have finished with a reality, it is is left barren and unable to sustain life. These form [[NecroCosm]]s where the worlds within are known as [[Chars]], dead embers orbiting cold stars.

The known agents of the Monad Group Corporation are:
- [[Abysson]] with their [[Abysson Space]]
- [[The Extant Maw]]
	- [[Entities/The Mawborn]]
- [[The Swarm]]
- The [[Oroboros Onton]] meme is especially prevalent in post-industrial civilisations on garden worlds and exhorts anyone affected to only place value on things once they have been processed. The aim is to quantify and consume.

Opposing them would be the sworn duty of the [[TransWorld Authority]], the [[Tindalean Lords]] and, naturally, any [[Disruptors]].
