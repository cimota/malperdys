*”The interdimensional keystone cops.”* - Reynard 

The TransWorld Authority was formed by an advanced humanoid society in response to their discovery of the multiverse. Such was the fear that multiverse technologies could be used for evil purposes, they took it upon themselves to found an agency charged with protecting the multiverse. They, of course, underestimated the scale of the problem to an extreme degree.

The current director of the TWA is Willard Orman. He has a philosophical view of the TWAs role, only taking action when it affects his home dimension. He knows his agency is laughably under-resourced for the scale of the responsibility.
# Technology
The TWA use doors to access the multiverse. A centrally controlled machine selects the destination of the doorway in the target dimension and passing through the doorway causes a moment of nausea and headaches before the traveller realises they have moved into a different dimension. They have more than a dozen such doors and therefore can deploy agents rapidly.
# Relationships
The TWA have a current detente with the [[Tindalean Lords]] and have executed several successful joint missions with their agents. Instability in the multiverse serves neither of their aims.
