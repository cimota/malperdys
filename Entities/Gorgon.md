# Essence
The Gorgon is a threshold entity, most often encountered where the [[Shift]] presses against the stable skein of a world. Its hallmark power is the petrifying gaze — but rather than turning flesh to stone, it forces the victim’s body into brittle carbon crystal. Bones, blood, and breath collapse into a fragile black lattice that shatters at a touch. The process is not instantaneous; a victim’s skin darkens first, eyes cloud with soot, and then rigidity spreads inward.

The Gorgon stalking the foggy [[Malperdys#The Demesne|Demesne]] of the [[Malperdys]] House is a tragic figure. Perpetually starving and only taking the entropic energy it needs from anyone lost in the fog, leaving carbon crystal statues in its wake. 
# Appearance
To different witnesses, the Gorgon may look like:
- A veiled woman with hair moving as if underwater.
- A bull forged of iron scales, its breath black smoke.
- A faceless figure whose eyes glow with the dull red of banked embers.
The form is mutable, but always suffused with the scent of burnt carbon.
# Behaviour
Gorgons haunt edges: cavern mouths, fog boundaries, doorways that lead into the [[Malperdys#The Demesne|Demesne]].
They are patient and do not pursue; they wait to be found.
Mirrors and reflective surfaces only delay them, not defeat them.
> Gorgons act with a -2 Modifier when in the presence of mirrors and reflective surfaces as they seek to avoid their own reflection.
# Origin
Gorgons are most commonly [[Refugees]] from [[Chars]]. Their petrification ability a remnant of their need to absorb energy from other living things.
# In Play
The Gorgon’s gaze forces a petrification test. On failure, the victim becomes brittle carbon, collapsing into shards if struck or moved roughly. 

> [!Mechanics]- YZE and Cypher Mechanics
> In **YZE** this is a Stamina test/Death Save.

> In **Cypher**, this is a test vs a Rank 7 Effect (TN: 21). Armour has no effect but magical shields or other defences may Ease it. Even wearing Mirrorshades may Ease the effect. 

Partial failures might leave limbs or features carbonized — permanent, fragile, and cold to the touch.

Defeating a Gorgon requires disrupting its concentration (loud noise, volitive shock), not just brute force. They can be slain by sufficient violence but may rise, phoenix-like, from their own ashes. The most effective method is to distract them while moving a mirror into place.

Remnants of shattered victims can be harvested; the brittle carbon sometimes retains memory or voice, whispering faintly when warmed. The vapours given off by these fragments may be breathed in and visions result. Once consumed in this way, these visions can never be retrieved and, in the unlikely event the victim is reconstituted, these memories or elements remain missing.
