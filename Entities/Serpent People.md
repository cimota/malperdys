An antediluvian race on Earth which fled the last ice age and came to live on [[Hyperborea]].

The Serpent People have strong magic. Though they are dwindling in number, they were numerous and powerful in the past, not only able to extend their lives by hundreds or thousands of years but also creating illusions and disguises. 

Their name is, of course, a misnomer. The Serpent People are certainly reptilian. They hail from a place known as [[Jiboor]].

Serpent people revere history above all else, commonly elevating it to the level of myth. They hold all reptilian life as sacred, but that doesn’t mean they are above murder.

The current self-appointed Lord of all Serpent People is [[Sarnash, Serpent Lord]]. Sarnash is a ‘regression’, having a humanoid upper body and a serpentine lower body. Their rule is based on personal charisma, [[Magic]] an awe over the divine nature of regressions.
