These entities are formed by budding off [[The Extant Maw]] where they become miniature versions of the whole, forever seeking to consume and grow. 

Mawborn may adopt other forms, unlike the [[The Extant Maw]], and invade minds; appearing almost sentient, but their motivation is always to overcome, to accumulate and to devour.
