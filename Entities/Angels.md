# Angel (Higher-Dimensional Organism)
_Classification: Trans-dimensional Entity_.
_Perceived Form: Calabi–Yau Manifold (partial projection)_.
_Threat Level: Existential_.
# Description
Angels are not beings in any familiar biological sense. They originate from higher-dimensional strata, their existence governed by [[Calabi–Yau Geometry]] rather than Euclidean space. When forced into three dimensions, their presence warps local reality: surfaces buckle, matter corrodes, and living tissue withers under exposure.

Their “appearance” is a misnomer. What can be seen is the shadow of their manifold — crystalline folds of space, luminous voids, endless surfaces unfolding into themselves.
# Known Properties
## Corrosive Manifestation
Their passage through real space destabilises atoms and molecules, causing rapid material decay. Metals pit, stone crumbles, and organic matter liquefies.
## Dimensional Distortion
Space bends around them. Distances elongate, walls buckle, and geometry twists into paradoxical forms.
## Perceptual Hazard
Prolonged observation induces migraines, vertigo, or psychosis. Minds attempt to, "flatten," higher-order shapes into inadequate concepts, breaking under the strain.
## Temporal Drag
Their presence disrupts causality — clocks stutter, bullets hang in mid-air, memories overlap.
# Interaction
## Detection
Invisible to unaided senses. Subtle signs include corrosion without heat, distorted echoes, and shadows with no source.
## Containment
Only a [[Tillinghast Resonator]] can partially anchor them, forcing the manifold into a visible and slowed state. Even then, the, "paused," Angel appears like a cathedral of impossible angles, bleeding light.
## Weaknesses
Unknown. Energy weapons and explosives pass through them with minimal effect, though [[Tillinghast Resonator|resonator-]]stabilisation may allow limited harm.
# In-Game Effects 
## Corrosive Aura
Within 10m, non-living matter decays; armour and weapons degrade rapidly.
## Psychic Assault
Any direct gaze forces a Resolve / Sanity check or temporary derangement.
## Dimensional Step
Angel vanishes from one location, reappears elsewhere, ignoring obstacles.
## Paused State
When a [[Tillinghast Resonator]] is active, Angel is visible and slowed, but not immobile — it may still lash out with fractal extensions or psychic waves.
# Hooks
- A ruined laboratory bears evidence of an Angel incursion; the Resonator still hums faintly.
- Survivors describe, "cathedrals made of glass and bone," walking through walls.
- A cult worships Angels as divine messengers, attempting to summon one without proper containment.
