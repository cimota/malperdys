An overarching description for any one of a number of parasitic entities who can only survive by feeding off sentient species. 

Vampires may be living or [[Undead]]. They may be [[Human]]shaped or may have other shapes and physiognomies.

## Vampires of [[Earth]]

There are numerous vampire types on Standard-Earth. From the disembodied heads of the East, such as the Penanggalan and Krasue, to the effete nobility of the West, cloaked in castles and etiquette. Some are revenants risen from shallow graves, others aristocrats cursed with unending appetite. The common theme is their thirst for human flesh and blood, though the method varies: biting, draining, devouring, or even inhaling life as breath. Vampires of Earth are among the most widely catalogued, their legends surviving in almost every tongue, yet their true [[Reality Meme|Ontonic]] root remains obscure. Most also have a distaste for Sunlight and Fire, though the root of this seems to be that only Sunlight and Fire can give them their final death.

## Vampires of [[Carcosa]]

The only extant species of Carcosa is a multi-limbed mollusc-like creature with hollow, translucent tentacles. Each tendril ends in a fine hypodermic spine used to pierce flesh and drain victims of their vital fluids. These leech-molluscs often accompany the spread of the Carcosan Reality Meme, slithering into existence spontaneously where the Meme has taken hold. They feed not only on blood but on coherence itself: victims often describe fading into dreamlike confusion as their life is drained away. It is unclear whether the leech-molluscs are true organisms or projected parasites given form by the Meme or indeed [[the King in Yellow]] - an entity whose visible manifestations include a cloaked form, with only rugose tentacles visible in place of feet.

## Vampires of [[Mars]]

The Vampires of Mars are more recognisable as “Martians” than the [[Red Martian|Red Martians]], [[Thark|Tharks]], and [[Thern|Therns]] of the [[Barsoom|Barsoomian]] distant past. These pale, elongated creatures have elevated their intellectual faculties to a dizzying height, but at the cost of their physical forms, which have withered into frailty. To endure, they rely on augmentation through machines: exoskeletal frames, draining engines, and needle-armed prosthetics. They feed by extracting fluids — blood, lymph, even the distilled essence of sap or ichor from non-human prey. Human blood is prized for its richness, and captives are often farmed in elaborate, sterile pens. See also [[Martians]].

## Vampires of the [[Dreamlands]]

The Dreamlands harbor vampires unlike any waking world. They are not singular species but manifestations of hunger within dream-logic. Some take the form of pale, whispering nobles who feast at endless banquets where every dish is a dreamer’s heart. Others appear as shadowy bats with human faces, wheeling silently through moonlit gulfs. The most dreaded are the Sleep Drinkers, incorporeal forms that settle upon a dreamer’s chest, drawing out not blood but rest itself, leaving the victim awake but never refreshed. The Dreamlands’ vampires often feed less on flesh than on continuity; draining memories, passions, or even entire identities from those who cross their path. These actions make vampires the impacable enemies of [[Ghouls]].

## Vampires of [[Hyperborea]]

Hyperborean vampires are remnants of a frigid, sunless age. Tall, gaunt, and pallid, they wander through polar wastes and crystalline caverns. Unlike their cousins elsewhere, they are not sated by blood alone; they drain vital heat, feeding on the life-fire that keeps mortals warm. Victims are left frozen in mid-stride, their bodies brittle as ice. Some Hyperborean vampires wear tattered remnants of ancient priest-robes, suggesting they were once a cult devoted to forgotten gods of frost. Others resemble alabaster statues, motionless until prey strays too close. Their presence heralds absolute silence: even the wind dies when they hunt.
