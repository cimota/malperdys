Nehemoth is an entity that feeds not on flesh, but on consequence, regret and cycles of ruin. It is the devoured of choices, the whisper behind every doomed decision and the slow erosion of will across time.

The Nehemoth is currently within [[The Labyrinth]]. 

Nehemoth is not worshipped in the traditional sense; it is acknowledged, like the looming weight of inevitability. Said to exist outside linear time, Nehemoth is a vast, eyeless presence that consumes the ripple effects of mortal actions, feeding on regret, unintended harm, and cascading ruin. It appears in fractured visions as a coil of endless bodies devouring each other’s tails, or a sprawling labyrinth where every path leads back to the same terrible choice.

Cults dedicated to Nehemoth do not seek salvation but acceleration; they entangle others in webs of impossible decisions, sowing dilemmas and betrayals, ensuring that the entity’s feast never ends. Often, they leave cryptic tokens behind: blackened coins stamped with a broken circle.

To its cultists, Nehemoth is not malevolent; it is the only truth. Their rituals involve reenactments of pivotal choices gone wrong, reenforcing that no deed escapes its consequence. Those touched by Nehemoth often find their lives unraveling in spirals of guilt and causality, as if something hungry is following just behind them, devouring every step they take.

Nehemoth is one of the [[Endless Things]]; horrors that will remain to the end of everything.
