The Fallen Lords is a moniker for the various powerful (and previously multiverse) entities who have, for whatever reason, become limited to a single reality.
# [[Sarnash, Serpent Lord]]: ruler of the [[Serpent People]] of [[Hyperborea]]

# [[Lord Varnae]]: Domain of [[Dread]]

# [[The King in Yellow]]
# [[The Sorcerer]] of [[The Emerald City]]

# The [[The Necromancer of Zothique]]
