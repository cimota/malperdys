Welcome to Malperdys

Malperdys is not a city, nor a world, but a house: singular, bounded, and deliberate. It stands at the heart of the Demesne, a liminal expanse that exists between realities rather than within them.

Malperdys was not constructed to shelter bodies alone, but to contain transitions. Its rooms are thresholds, its corridors negotiations between states of being. The house does not obey a fixed interior logic. Doors open onto places that are distant in space, displaced in time, or adjacent only in a metaphysical sense. Some rooms recur; others vanish once served. The house remembers occupants long after they have left, and in some cases, long after they have ceased to exist elsewhere.

The Demesne surrounding Malperdys is not empty space but a pressure field: a realm of half-formed realities, abandoned timelines, and unrealised possibilities. Within it, Malperdys acts as an anchor. It does not stabilise the Demesne so much as give it a point of reference, a place where meaning briefly coheres. But as the house is a refuge, do not stray far from it; the Demesne is not to be trifled with.

Malperdys is old, but not static. It adapts by accretion rather than growth, absorbing functions, rooms, and purposes as necessity demands. It is neither benevolent nor hostile. It exists to persist, and in doing so becomes a refuge, a prison, an archive, or a crossroads depending on who enters and why.
