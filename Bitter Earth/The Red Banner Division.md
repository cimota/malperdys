The Red Banner Division is the Soviet counterpart to the [[Office of Special Projects]], operating under Stalin’s direct orders and known for brutal methods and internal purges.

According to the [[Office of Special Projects|OSP]], they are half of the [[Red Line]].
# Red Banner Division (Краснознамённое подразделение / Krasnoznamyónnoye podrazdeleniye)
The Red Banner Division is the Soviet Union’s premier superhuman command, forged in the aftermath of World War II as the USSR scrambled to match the terrifying power displayed by American super soldiers. Unlike the United States, which developed superhumans through intensive research and controlled programs, the Soviet approach has always been more pragmatic and opportunistic—rooted in brutal necessity and ruthless exploitation.

The foundation of the Division rests on a series of covert, "[[Transference]] Programs," initiated during and immediately after the war. Soviet intelligence, through infiltration, espionage, and battlefield capture, successfully procured critical samples, research, and—most importantly—living American super soldiers or their progeny. Many of these individuals were subjected to forcible experimentation, drained of whatever biological or ontological factors that made them superhuman, then discarded or neutralised. Over time, this grisly process allowed Soviet scientists to synthesize their own crude and often unstable versions of superhuman abilities.

The Division is directly overseen by both the GRU and the inner circles of the MGB (later KGB), operating under the iron grip of Stalin’s security apparatus. Its operatives are not only weapons of the state but also ideological tools—bred, brainwashed, and conditioned to embody Soviet supremacy. Every agent of the Red Banner Division is subject to intense political indoctrination, constant surveillance, and ruthless discipline; loyalty is absolute, and deviation is met with swift removal, whether by bullet or exile to the gulags.
# Structure & Units
## Shock Regiment (“[[The Iron Sickle]]”)
Elite superhuman strike forces used for rapid assaults, sabotage, and demonstrations of Soviet might during proxy conflicts and internal purges.
## Directorate of Internal Security (“[[The Comrades’ Eyes]]”)
Embedded political officers and informants charged with monitoring superhuman personnel for signs of disloyalty, defeatism, or foreign sympathies. Responsible for frequent purges.
## Scientific Section (“[[The Red Crucible]]”)
Oversees the continued “Transference” experiments, including forced breeding programs, unethical enhancement trials, and harvesting of foreign superhuman material. Known for high mortality rates among test subjects.
## Revolutionary Youth Brigade (“[[The Lenin Vanguard]]”)
A training program for young Soviet [[Emergents]], often the children of prior, "[[Transference]]," subjects or selected through secretive nationwide sweeps. Indoctrination begins at an early age, turning them into living symbols of Communist progress.
# Doctrine & Reputation
While American and Western agencies debate civil liberties and oversight, the Red Banner Division views superhumans as state property—tools to be sharpened, used, and, if necessary, destroyed. Their agents are highly effective but often physically and psychologically unstable due to the rough, reverse-engineered methods of their creation.

Outside the USSR, the Red Banner Division is whispered about in diplomatic and intelligence circles as a shadow army—capable of destabilizing governments, eliminating dissidents, or tipping proxy wars. However, the Division’s greatest threat may not be external at all; the combination of superhuman volatility and Stalinist paranoia makes the Division a ticking time bomb, as likely to implode from internal purges as to march on foreign soil.
# Key Personnel
## Major Ivan “Koschei” Morozov (Иван “Кощей” Морозов)
Codename: [[Koschei]]
A towering figure with pale, unnervingly gaunt features, Morozov is nicknamed after Koschei the Deathless, the immortal villain of Russian folklore. Subjected to one of the earliest successful Soviet transference procedures, his aging process has all but stopped—but at a terrible cost. His body heals rapidly, but he feels no physical pleasure or sensation, making him cold, emotionless, and utterly detached. He serves as one of the Division’s most feared enforcers, specializing in, "loyalty corrections," both at home and abroad.
## Commissar Alexei Dragunov (Алексей Драгунов)
Codename: [[The Black Commissar]]
Dragunov doesn’t possess overt powers himself, but he is the Division’s internal watchdog and political officer, answerable directly to the MGB. Known for his ruthless efficiency, he has personally overseen the liquidation of several fellow operatives deemed, "ideologically impure". His presence is dreaded by all—he travels with Division units, observes missions, and quietly decides who lives and who vanishes after debriefing. Some whisper that he has access to a cadre of experimental psychic interrogators trained to extract every secret from those he suspects.
## Captain Svetlana Petrokina (Светлана Петровкина)
Codename: [[Crimson Kestrel]] (Багровый Сокол / Bagrovy Sokol)
Raised from childhood within the Division’s indoctrination camps, Svetlana is a lethal blend of disciplined soldier and conditioned ideologue. Gifted with heightened reflexes, surgical combat precision, and minor precognitive flashes, she is deployed as a surgical strike weapon—swift, sharp, and merciless. Her codename, Crimson Kestrel, reflects both her speed and her symbolic role as a “hunter” of enemies of the Soviet state. Though outwardly loyal, rumors swirl that her exposure to foreign ideas during missions has sown dangerous doubts beneath her unwavering façade.
# Hooks & Plot Ideas
• Defectors from the Division carrying knowledge of Soviet “Transference” programs seek asylum in the West, pursued relentlessly by Red Banner agents.
• Rogue elements within the Division, disillusioned by ideological brutality, attempt to form their own power base.
• The [[Office of Special Projects|OSP]] discovers evidence that some captured American supersoldiers were never killed but remain imprisoned in Siberian black sites.
