Emergents are the unpredictable, often uncontrollable second wave of superhumans who began appearing after World War II. Unlike the carefully constructed operatives of Project [[Vanguard]] or the rigidly controlled subjects of [[Project Bastion]], Emergents arise without government oversight, military conditioning, or fail-safe protocols. Many are the children of [[Vanguard]] veterans or individuals unknowingly exposed to experimental superhuman technologies, battlefield energies, or latent enhancement compounds used during the war. Others manifest their abilities without any clear link, suggesting that whatever unlocked superhuman potential in humanity is no longer fully containable.

Their name comes from [[Office of Special Projects|OSP]] classification documents: Emergent Superhuman Phenomena (ESP)—later shortened to simply Emergents. To the public, Emergents are both a fascination and a source of growing fear. They are living reminders that the era of the superhuman weapon did not end with peace treaties; it lives on in the next generation, walking among civilians without loyalty oaths, government-issued dog tags, or the rigid discipline of wartime programs.
# Characteristics
Emergents are wildly varied in terms of power sets, control, and stability. Unlike [[Vanguard]] operatives, whose abilities were designed and refined, Emergents’ powers often develop haphazardly, frequently during puberty, moments of stress, or traumatic events. Many struggle with their abilities, lacking mentors or institutional guidance. Some possess minor physical enhancements or sensory abilities; others exhibit reality-warping phenomena far beyond what military programs have seen.

The [[Office of Special Projects|OSP]] maintains a secret registry of known or suspected Emergents, offering them “protection” while subtly keeping them under surveillance. In truth, the agency considers them unpredictable liabilities and monitors them closely, prepared to neutralize potential threats.
# Social Status
Emergents occupy a precarious place in post-war American society. On one hand, their abilities can be lucrative; certain industries, criminal syndicates, and even foreign powers quietly seek them out. On the other hand, they face widespread discrimination, suspicion, and the looming spectre of government intervention. Many Emergents live in fear of the knock at their door; an OSP team offering, "voluntary," registration, followed by intense interrogation and possibly forced enlistment or containment.

Some Emergents attempt to blend in, hiding their powers entirely. Others find refuge in underground networks, including the rumoured [[Emergent Underground]], a loose coalition of disillusioned superhumans resisting [[Office of Special Projects|OSP]] control. Still others become tools of organized crime, blackmailed or manipulated by groups like the [[Ashfields]] or foreign operatives.
# Tensions with [[Vanguard]] & [[Project Bastion|Bastion]]
[[Vanguard]] veterans, now aging and often broken by their own experiences, tend to view Emergents with a mixture of pity, protectiveness, or distrust. Some see in them a chance for redemption, mentoring them to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. Others fear that the lack of discipline and oversight makes Emergents walking time bombs.

[[Project Bastion]], in contrast, views Emergents as threat vectors—proof that the state must double down on control measures. [[Project Bastion|Bastion]] scientists conduct covert studies to trace Emergent bloodlines, identifying candidates for forced recruitment, containment, or experimentation.
# Potential Hooks:
- An Emergent character’s powers manifest violently, drawing [[Office of Special Projects|OSP]] attention and triggering a manhunt.
- The [[Coalition|Emergent Underground]] reaches out to player characters, offering sanctuary—but at a steep price.
- A [[Vanguard]] veteran seeks out Emergents, either to mentor them… or eliminate those deemed too dangerous.
- Evidence surfaces suggesting the Emergent phenomenon may be accelerating, hinting at a larger, uncontrolled shift in humanity itself.
