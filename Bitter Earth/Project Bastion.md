Following the end of World War II, the U.S. government viewed the [[Vanguard]] program as both a triumph and a cautionary tale. While [[Vanguard]] operatives had undeniably turned the tide of battle, they were volatile, unpredictable, and psychologically scarred; living weapons with minds of their own. In the paranoia and uncertainty of the postwar period, this was deemed unacceptable. Thus, Project Bastion was born: an attempt to create a second, more refined generation of superhumans, designed not just for strength and resilience, but absolute control.

Unlike [[Vanguard]], Bastion candidates were selected young—often infants or orphans identified as having latent potential (those who would become [[Emergents]], particularly those born to [[Vanguard]] veterans or affected by their battlefield exposure. From birth, every aspect of their development was carefully monitored: diet, education, socialization, even genetic manipulation. The core doctrine of Bastion was containment before capability—power meant nothing if it could not be controlled.

Where [[Vanguard]] had a simple [[The October Failsafe|spoken-word failsafe]], Bastion operatives were subjected to layered failsafes, known as the [[Sovereign Contingency]]

1. Neurological Inhibitor Implants: Micro-devices embedded at the base of the skull, capable of remotely triggering seizures, unconsciousness, or even lethal shutdown if operatives displayed insubordination.

2. Psychological Fragmentation: Bastion recruits underwent early-life dissociative conditioning, segmenting their personalities into mission-focused sub-personas. Each sub-persona could be “activated” or “deactivated” through specific command sequences, effectively turning off any dangerous free will.

3. Pharmacological Dependence: Bastion operatives were biochemically engineered to be dependent on regular injections—without them, they would suffer debilitating physical and mental collapse. Only handlers had access to the stabilizing compounds.

4. Spoken Command Overrides: A far more complex and sophisticated evolution of the Vanguard failsafe, utilizing multi-phrase sequences encoded to the subject’s fragmented psyche. Some operatives had no conscious awareness they were compromised.

The result? Superhumans who could be deployed without hesitation, feared neither by their government nor their handlers—because they could be terminated or neutralized at any time.

However, the cost was profound. Many Bastion operatives burned out young, suffering catastrophic mental breakdowns or early death due to the intensity of their conditioning. Others exist as hollow shells of who they might have been, loyal but devoid of independent thought.

A fringe conspiracy claims a splinter group from Bastion operates autonomously, guided by rogue scientists and escaped superhumans attempting to build a nation within a nation—one where the, "enhanced," rule without oversight. See: [[The Succession]]
