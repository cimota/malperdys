Project Vanguard was America’s first and most secretive foray into the creation of superhuman soldiers—the original generation of supers, developed in the crucible of World War II. Unlike later [[Emergents]], who would manifest abilities unpredictably and often hereditarily, Vanguard operatives were the result of deliberate, government-controlled experimentation. Selected from a mix of volunteers, expendable convicts ([[Iron Jacks]]), and occasionally unwitting test subjects, these individuals were subjected to radical enhancement regimens: cutting-edge biochemistry, surgical modification, psychological conditioning, and, in some cases, exposure to barely understood exotic energies. The result was a cadre of living weapons—stronger, faster, more resilient than any normal soldier, but carrying immense psychological and physical costs.

From the beginning, the U.S. government feared what it had created. To ensure absolute loyalty, each Vanguard operative was embedded with a deeply ingrained spoken-word [[The October Failsafe|failsafe]]—a post-hypnotic trigger implanted through trauma conditioning and chemical reinforcement. Each operative was keyed to a unique phrase or sequence, known only to high-level military or DSA (now [[Office of Special Projects|OSP]]) handlers. Upon hearing their trigger, the subject could be rendered docile, stripped of higher cognition, and their powers deactivated for a short period, hopefully enough time to neutralise them in other ways. Officially, the failsafe was, "precautionary"; in truth, it was a leash, ensuring that America’s first supers would never turn on their masters. Many Vanguard veterans live in quiet terror of those words—never knowing when, or if, they will be spoken.

During active duty, the Vanguard worked alongside the [[Shadow Sirens]] (though the latter were restricted to the European theatre.)
