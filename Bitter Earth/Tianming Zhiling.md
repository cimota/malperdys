# The Heavenly Mandate Directive (天命指令 / Tiānmìng Zhǐlìng)
Emerging in the chaotic twilight of WWII, the Heavenly Mandate Directive was born from the ashes of occupation, civil war, and centuries of fractured rule. Named after the ancient Chinese principle that the right to rule is divinely sanctioned but conditional, the Directive positions itself as the unseen hand ensuring that China’s destiny is neither dictated by foreign empires nor left to internal disunity. Comprised of an uneasy alliance of Nationalist and Communist-aligned forces, alongside secretive elders from China’s occult traditions, the Directive serves no singular regime—its loyalty is to China itself, as it interprets the mandate of Heaven.

Blending cutting-edge wartime science with arcane Taoist practices, the Directive’s operatives include augmented soldiers, mystical practitioners, and those believed to have inherited rare bloodlines tied to China’s mythic past. These superhuman assets are rigorously controlled, their loyalty enforced through ancient rites, ideological conditioning, and, if necessary, brutal discipline. The Directive has little patience for weakness or sentiment; they see superhuman ability as both a blessing and a dangerous burden—a divine weapon to be wielded without hesitation to repel invaders, manipulate rivals, and maintain China’s sovereignty.

Post-civil war, both the Nationalist government in Taiwan and the Communist regime on the mainland claim control over fragments of the Heavenly Mandate Directive. In truth, many cells operate independently, answering only to the clandestine council known as the Circle of the Celestial Seal (天璽圈 / Tiānxǐ Quān). Some Western intelligence agencies suspect the Directive is meddling not just in East Asian affairs but globally, quietly neutralizing foreign superhuman threats and acquiring lost Axis research for its own purposes.

Tianming Zhiling forms part of the [[Red Line]] alongside [[The Red Banner Division|Red Banner Division]], the [[Red Lanterns]] and the [[Eight Banners of Justice]].

# History
## The Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945)
For China, WWII effectively began before it officially started elsewhere. The Second Sino-Japanese War erupted in 1937 following years of rising tension and Japanese incursions, particularly after the invasion of Manchuria in 1931 (where Japan established the puppet state of Manchukuo).

Japan’s full-scale invasion in 1937 led to brutal campaigns, including atrocities like the Nanjing Massacre (1937-1938), where hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed soldiers were murdered. Cities such as Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chongqing became key battlegrounds.

Despite Japan’s superior military power, China mounted fierce resistance, engaging in a prolonged war of attrition. The Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石 / Jiǎng Jièshí) bore the brunt of leadership, but significant fighting was also conducted by Mao Zedong’s Communist forces, particularly through guerrilla warfare.
## Chinese Civil War Pause
During WWII, the ongoing Chinese Civil War between the Nationalists (Kuomintang, KMT) and Communists was put on hold (though sporadic clashes still occurred). Both sides entered into an uneasy Second United Front against Japan, though mutual distrust persisted.
## Allied Recognition & Contribution
China was one of the Big Four Allies, alongside the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union. The country received crucial support through the Lend-Lease Act and supplies sent over the dangerous Burma Road and later via The Hump—a perilous airlift over the Himalayas conducted by American pilots.

Chinese forces tied down over 500,000 Japanese troops throughout the war—troops that might otherwise have been deployed elsewhere in the Pacific, contributing significantly to the overall Allied war effort by stretching Japanese resources thin.
## Chiang Kai-shek on the Global Stage
Chiang Kai-shek represented China at major Allied conferences, such as Cairo (1943), where post-war plans were discussed, including the return of territories like Taiwan to China. China’s status as a permanent member of the future United Nations Security Council was secured during this period, recognizing its sacrifices and strategic importance.
## Internal Struggles & Aftermath
Despite being an Allied power, China suffered immensely:
• Estimated 15-20 million Chinese deaths
• Widespread devastation, famine, and displacement
• Major urban centers bombed repeatedly (e.g., Chongqing)

After Japan’s surrender in 1945, the fragile alliance between the Nationalists and Communists collapsed, and the Chinese Civil War resumed in full force, leading eventually to the Communist victory in 1949 and the establishment of the People’s Republic of China.
