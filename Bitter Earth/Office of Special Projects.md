The Office of Special Projects (OSP) is a bureaucratically sprawling arm of the U.S. government, established in 1947 to manage the delicate and increasingly volatile matter of America’s superhuman population. It emerged from the ashes of the wartime [[Department of Superhuman Affairs]] (DSA), restructured in response to public anxiety, Congressional hearings, and growing fears of unchecked superhuman power destabilizing post-war society. Nominally a division under the Department of Defence, the [[Office of Special Projects|OSP]] answers to a rotating civilian-military oversight committee—The [[Joint Special Projects Oversight Committee]] (JSPOC)—composed of senior Pentagon officials, select members of Congress, and intelligence directors. In theory, this provides checks and balances; in practice, layers of red tape, secret directives, and classified appropriations grant the [[Office of Special Projects|OSP]] extraordinary leeway. Officially, they are charged with protecting American interests from the forces of the [[Red Line]].

The agency’s remit covers everything from licensing and surveillance of known superhumans (both veterans of the war and second-generation, "[[Emergents]]") to containment, black-ops deployment, and research into superhuman biology and technologies. Within the OSP are multiple divisions: Field Operations, which handles active missions and incident response; Special Containment, responsible for detaining dangerous or unstable individuals; Scientific Research & Development, a labyrinthine web of labs conducting ethically murky experiments; and Public Liaison, a PR front aimed at maintaining public trust while revealing as little as possible. Additionally, every registered superhuman is subject to mandatory periodic evaluations and loyalty assessments, conducted under the authority of the OSP.

While officially bound by oversight, the OSP is notorious for its opacity. Its agents, often drawn from intelligence circles, military special forces, or even, "rehabilitated," supers, operate under multiple levels of clearance. There are persistent rumours of unauthorized detention facilities, assassination programs, and secret deals struck with foreign powers to contain or neutralize superhuman threats. For the average American citizen, the OSP is a distant, bureaucratic name; for those within the superhuman community, it is an omnipresent shadow, wielding both the carrot of government protection and the stick of indefinite containment.

Any affairs involving [[Vanguard]], [[Iron Jacks]] or [[Shadow Sirens|Rosies]] should have a OSP handler assigned.
