# Archetype
Seasoned [[Vanguard]] (NCO)
# Age
38
# Current Status
Listed as Missing; suspected deserter
# Origin & Background
Born in 1912 in Cleveland, Ohio, Alma Vescari grew up in an immigrant Italian family during the Great Depression. The daughter of steelworkers, she learned resilience young, taking on factory work at 14 to support her family. She developed a reputation for iron discipline and fierce protectiveness of those under her care.
## Education & Early Service:
• No formal higher education; street-smart, self-taught.
• Enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1936, assigned to a logistics support unit before transferring to infantry.
• Demonstrated exceptional leadership skills and adaptability; promoted to Sergeant by 1942.
## Supersoldier Service Record:
• Volunteered (or was strongly encouraged) for the Supersoldier Enhancement Program in 1944.
• Assigned as senior NCO to [[Vanguard]] 9th Regiment, nicknamed, "The Ironwardens".
• Known for maintaining unit cohesion and morale, even after brutal front-line engagements.
## Wartime Notables
• Led a critical defensive operation in the Battle of Metz, holding a strategic chokepoint for three days without reinforcements.
• Personally extracted wounded squads from behind enemy lines using sheer force and tactical acumen.
• Recognized for preventing a potential internal mutiny during the chaotic final push in Okinawa.
# Powers & Enhancements
1. Superhuman Endurance: Capable of operating without sleep or sustenance for extended periods. Resistant to exhaustion and environmental extremes.
2. Enhanced Reflexive Shielding: Unconsciously generates a kinetic field that absorbs and redirects incoming blunt force and small-arms fire, providing cover for herself and nearby allies.
3. Command Presence Augmentation: Unnatural ability to command attention and compliance—lower-ranking soldiers feel compelled to obey, sometimes overriding fear or common sense.
# Known Side Effects
• Displays signs of chronic insomnia, migraines, and emotional detachment.
• After prolonged power use, becomes withdrawn, emotionless, and cold.
• Last noted exhibiting early-stage [[Strain Collapse Syndrome|Strain Collapse]] symptoms, including hallucinations of wartime events.
# Post-War Status
Following demobilization, Alma Vescari declined repeated [[Office of Special Projects|OSP]] offers for a training or advisory role. Last officially seen in 1948 after attending a veterans’ reunion in New York. Subsequent sightings suggest she may have joined, or is leading, an underground network of former super soldiers and unregistered [[Emergents]] operating independently.

[[Office of Special Projects|OSP]] categorizes her as a Classified Person of Interest (Priority 2). Approach with caution.
# Personality
Vescari is a steel-willed, pragmatic leader with little tolerance for inefficiency or sentimentality. She's fiercely loyal to her fellow soldiers but deeply distrustful of government authority, particularly after witnessing how expendable the [[Vanguard]] units became post-war.

To those she trusts, she’s a protector; to bureaucrats, she’s a dangerous rogue asset. There’s speculation that she’s working to safeguard Emergent civilians from [[Office of Special Projects|OSP]] containment.
