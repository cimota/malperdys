The Bitter Earth is a reality parallel where they did not create atomic weapons for World War 2, but instead the USA created superhumans known as the [[Vanguard]]. They were joined by the [[Shadow Sirens]] (also known as the [[Shadow Sirens|Rosies]]) and the [[Iron Jacks]] (conscripts subjected to the superhuman process). These superhumans were dropped *en masse* to the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and wreaked devastation.

Now the planet must deal with the repercussions of that, the repatriation of damaged super soldiers and the appearance of [[Emergents|Emergent]] superhumans, all while the US is gripped with the Red Scare. Some [[Emergents]] are recruited into the effort and others are either captured or terminated.

Superhumans on Bitter Earth are susceptible to a condition called, "[[Strain Collapse Syndrome]]," which impacts their minds and bodies with excessive use of their abilities. There are processes a chemicals which can reduce the effect of [[Strain Collapse Syndrome|SCS]]. Those who manage to avoid capture or execution organise themselves in survivor communities known as the [[Ashfields]]. 

The body in the US which deals with superhuman affairs is the [[Office of Special Projects]]. One of their primary activities is [[Project Bastion]], a furthering of the superhuman program to breed and condition loyal, second generation superhumans. 

The [[Red Line]] is the unknown quantity of Communist Bloc superhuman programs, particularly from the Soviet Union and China. [[Vanguard]] and [[Red Line]] troops are often involved in proxy wars, espionage and black ops.

There is also a covert [[Coalition]] of [[Emergent]] deserters, rogue scientists, and black marketeers. They have no official ties to any government or nation and are motivated by profit, survival and avoiding the control of the [[Office of Special Projects|OSP]] and the [[Red Line]] handlers. They operate in the shadows, supplying illegal stabilizers, smuggling unregistered [[Emergents]] and sometimes destabilizing governments.
