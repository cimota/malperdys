The October Failsafe was the brainchild of Professor [[Brett October]], a scientist working on the first [[Vanguard]]. In truth he was terrified by the prospect of humanity being replaced by these superhumans and created an auditory failsafe which would immediately deactivate the powers of any [[Vanguard]] within hearing range. The deactivation could be for minutes or hours.
