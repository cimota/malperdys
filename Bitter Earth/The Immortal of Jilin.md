Emerging from the chaos of the Qing Dynasty’s collapse, the Immortal of Jilin has loomed large over China’s fractured landscape for over a century. Known by many names—most famously Jiu Manzhou, a moniker evoking ties to Manchu heritage—he commands both fear and reverence across northern China. His true name is lost to history, buried beneath layers of myth and carefully curated obscurity.

Famed for his mastery of martial disciplines, esoteric knowledge, and uncanny longevity, Jilin Xian’s early rise coincided with the increasing encroachment of foreign powers on Chinese soil. In response, he founded the [[Eight Banners of Justice]] (正义八旗 / Zhèngyì Bāqí), a militant, quasi-mystical order modeled after the Manchu military system. Originally positioned as a Boxer-like resistance, the group was notable not only for its martial prowess but also for incorporating the [[Red Lanterns]] (红灯照 / Hóng Dēngzhào)—a formidable women’s auxiliary trained in both combat and subversive arts.

While fiercely xenophobic and openly hostile to foreign domination, Jilin Xian is no crude zealot. He understands the value of diplomacy, commerce, and technology, though he distrusts any foreigner who sets foot on Chinese soil. Visitors may be granted an audience, but woe to those who attempt to exploit his hospitality—he would rather sever a foreigner’s feet than allow them to take so much as a speck of Chinese dust home.

Legends swirl around his agelessness, attributing it to strict dietary regimes, relentless martial discipline, and whispered tales of arcane rites. Some claim his continued vitality stems from ancient Daoist practices; others whisper darker pacts. Whether through bloodline, magic, or sheer will, Jilin Xian shows no signs of decline. He has amassed a sprawling family—multiple wives over the decades (never concurrently), a brood of fiercely loyal children, and trusted lieutenants trained in his exacting philosophy.

Though the Communist regime and the Heavenly Mandate Directive exert control over much of China, Jilin Xian maintains an independent power base, his Eight Banners operating as both shadow militia and guardians of the northeastern territories. Relations between him and the Directive are complicated: at times allies against foreign incursions, at times rivals over control and ideology. Neither side trusts the other fully, but both recognize the other’s utility.
