# Archetype

# Age
42
# Current Status
Active Duty, [[Office of Special Projects]] Liaison
# Origin & Background
Born in 1908 in Butte, Montana, Robert Dee grew up the son of a copper miner in a rough, working-class family. His early years were defined by hardship and resilience—losing his father to a mining accident at age 12 forced him into labour to support his family. He developed a reputation for tenacity, discipline, and a cold pragmatism even as a young man
## Education
• Graduated high school at 19 after delayed schooling due to family obligations.
• Earned a congressional appointment to West Point Military Academy, class of 1932.
• Specialized in Infantry Tactics and Command Strategy, consistently marked by instructors as, "hard-edged, uncompromising, but reliable".
## Service Record
• Commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Infantry post-graduation.
• Early postings included deployments to the Philippines and the U.S.-Mexico border.
• Promoted rapidly during the early years of World War II, rising to Lieutenant Colonel by 1943.
• Volunteered for the Supersoldier Enhancement Program (Project Vanguard) in 1943, one of the earliest officer candidates.
## Wartime Notables
• Led the Iron Vanguards unit in the storming of key positions during Operation Overlord (D-Day).
• Responsible for the destruction of three fortified Wehrmacht positions single-handedly during the Ardennes counteroffensive.
• Earned the nickname, "Ironhand," after tearing open a Panzer turret with his bare hands to pull the crew out.
• Post-war, reassigned to the [[Office of Special Projects]] (OSP) as a liaison and trainer for [[Emergents|emergent]] recruits, though he is kept under constant observation.
# Powers & Enhancements
1. Hyper-Physical Conditioning: Superhuman strength, durability, and reaction time well beyond baseline humans. Capable of lifting small vehicles, surviving direct hits from heavy weaponry.
2. Battlefield Awareness: Enhanced reflexes and spatial processing, allowing near-instant analysis of battlefield conditions. Appears to “anticipate” enemy movements.
3. Regenerative Resilience: Rapid healing factor—non-fatal wounds close within minutes. However, repeated healing cycles have begun to cause scar tissue buildup and chronic migraines.
# Known Side Effects
• Requires twice the caloric intake of an average soldier.
• Prone to bouts of severe aggression and insomnia.
• Recently flagged with early signs of [[Strain Collapse Syndrome]]—though he refuses treatment.
# Personality
Dee is a blunt, uncompromising officer—a battlefield pragmatist who views loyalty and efficiency above all else. He carries deep guilt for the devastation wrought in the Pacific, particularly in Hiroshima, though he buries it beneath discipline and control. To subordinates, he’s both a stern mentor and an unpredictable force. To [[Office of Special Projects|OSP]] brass, he’s a useful, but increasingly unstable, asset.

Rumours persist that Dee has been in quiet contact with other [[Vanguard|Vanguards]], possibly organizing a loose network of veterans outside [[Office of Special Projects|OSP]] oversight.
