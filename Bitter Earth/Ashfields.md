A powerful, dynastic family whose wealth predates the emergence of superhumans, the Ashfields have positioned themselves as kingmakers in postwar America. Publicly, they present themselves as philanthropists and industrialists, with significant stakes in energy, defence contracting, and media. 

Behind the scenes, the Ashfields are deeply enmeshed in the superhuman world—both as sponsors of private superhuman teams and as key influencers in policy circles. They are rumoured to have their own network of [[Emergents|Emergent]] operatives, many bound by loyalty, blackmail, or debt. Some claim the family has access to pre-war super-soldier research; possibly even controlling strains of the original enhancement formula. The Ashfields’ true agenda remains obscured, but whispers suggest they view the post-war chaos as an opportunity to consolidate not just economic power, but superhuman dominance.
