  - Emergent Underground
---
A loose, decentralized network of unregistered superhumans, disillusioned veterans, and second-generation [[Emergents]] seeking to avoid [[Office of Special Projects|OSP]] control. While some factions within the Coalition advocate for peaceful resistance, others have turned to violent sabotage, seeing the government as irredeemably corrupt. The [[Ashfields]] are rumoured to manipulate parts of this network, though whether they fund or hunt them is unclear. The [[Office of Special Projects|OSP]] designates this Emergent underground as a domestic terror threat, conducting regular raids and surveillance operations to dismantle cells before they can gain traction.
