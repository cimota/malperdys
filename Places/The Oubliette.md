The Oubliette was first discovered in the late 19th Century by [[The Time Traveller]]. This is a far-future version of [[Earth]] where all human life has died out. In this place, near the end of life on Earth, is a prison. And this is where the worst of the worst end up. 

It’s in the far future because then it would require a particular talent to become a threat again. Sending enemies to the distant past always had the problem that they end up stepping on butterflies.
# Traffic
The [[Tindalean Lords]] visit most often, usually to deposit a new inmate. This is also a prime location to encounter [[Irisian|Irisians]], mostly likely visiting their family members within the walls. 
# Notable Inmates

[[The Time Traveller]] - self-imposed exile in the prison he commissioned.
