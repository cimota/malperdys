The Flying Island-City of Laputa is located in (or more properly, above) the realm of [[Places/Balnibarbi]]. Within this reality, an element exists within the grounds of Laputa and Balnibarbi  providing certain magnetic properties and causing the island of Laputa to float.

The people of Laputa and Balnibarbi are human and believe they are still connected to the remainder of [[Earth]] and will truck no talk of different realities or pocket universes.
