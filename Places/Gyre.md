> "A world spun by mad gods and broken by wiser men."

The Gyre is a land of crumbling empires, poisoned magic, and old blood. Shaped by a thousand years of war, prophecy, and betrayal, it turns endlessly toward its own undoing, caught in a spiral of rising powers and ancient horrors. No age lasts long in the Gyre. Thrones pass from weak hands to cruel ones. Heroes are burned into legend, then scraped from memory. The seas boil with monsters, the winds whisper with curses, and the land itself is wounded, bleeding fog, salt, and rot.

Once, the world held shape; a [[First Empire]] of iron discipline and high sorcery, stretching from the basalt cliffs of [[Isk]] to the burning towers of [[Valdrath]]. That empire shattered, as all things do, but its bones remain beneath every city, every throne. Its magic still leaks into the cracks of the world—mutating, tempting, damning. No one trusts sorcery now, but all crave its power.

The northern Holds are cold and proud, ruled by blood-oath and blade. The southern cities are decadent, thrumming with conspiracy and cult. Inland lie the haunted steppes and drowned kingdoms, where the dead whisper in forgotten tongues. Across the western sea, the [[Isles of Smoke]] dream in exile, guarding secrets older than gods. And beneath it all, in the hollows of the earth, something ancient stirs, something that remembers a time before the Gyre began to spin.

Magic here is neither safe nor clean. It stains. It costs. It remembers. The world has no Chosen Ones, only survivors; sellswords, oathbreakers, witches, and outcasts. The gods, if they still exist, are silent or laughing.

In the Gyre, nothing is ever truly lost. Only buried. Only waiting.
# Notable Paces
## Caelroch, the Storm-Crowned Isles
“No peace, no coin, no law but the knife.”

A scattered archipelago ruled by warring sea-kings, broken clans, and reaver cults. Once home to scholars and sky-readers, the Isles now answer only to wind, tide, and old grudges. Storms batter the shores year-round, and shipwrecks litter the reefs like bones. Some say the sea gods abandoned Caelroch for its bloodshed. Others say they watch from beneath the waves, growing hungry.

Notable Faction: The [[Brine Pact]]—reaver-mystics who carve their skin with maps and trade drowned relics for power.
## Nurnvale and the Velvet Reach
“A land of poets, poisoners, and perfumed death.”

Once the cultural heart of the Gyre, Nurnvale is now a crumbling jewel. The Velvet Reach is its lush riverland—rich, warm, and filled with songbirds and spies. The nobility here speak in riddles, sing ballads laced with double meaning, and murder one another with a smile. Behind every masque is a dagger. Behind every garden, a grave.

Notable Faction: The [[House of Blossoming Mercy]] - a monastery of poisoners who brew both antidote and affliction, offering ‘kind endings’ to those who pay.
## Skarhold and the Ironspire Range
“They burn their dead because they remember what happens when they don’t.”

A harsh northern land of granite peaks, glacial valleys, and stone-fortresses. Skarhold’s people are stoic, insular, and deeply superstitious. They mine deep into the mountains for god-metals and emberstone, though they dare not speak of what they’ve woken in the deep hollows. Their legends speak of, "[[The Underthing]]," a buried memory that has started to dream again.

Notable Faction: The [[Emberforged]]—war-smiths who bind armor to soul, forging weapons that whisper when drawn.
## Thireen, City of Knives
“Where gold glitters, blood flows, and secrets cost more than steel.”

Built in tiers upon a black basalt cliff overlooking the Sea of Shards, Thireen is a free city ruled by merchant dynasties and assassins’ guilds. Its skyline is dominated by blade-shaped towers, each representing a noble house. Sorcery is practiced behind curtained balconies, and power changes hands through duels, poison, or marriage pacts that rarely last the night.

Notable Faction: The [[Crimson Cord]]—part salon, part cult, part espionage service; they deal in dreams, enchantments, and surgical memory theft.
## Varnhal Keep and the Hollow Marches
“Where kings go to die and revenants rise.”

A ruined borderland of moors, battlegrounds, and sunken barrows. Once a proud duchy, Varnhal was swallowed by war and witchcraft during the Barrow Wars. Now it’s ruled by claimants, crows, and worse. The Hollow Marches are dotted with burial mounds that should never have been disturbed, and the Varnhal bloodline is said to carry a curse that ensures no heir survives past their thirty-third year.

Notable Faction: The [[Gravewatch]], a brotherhood of exiled knights who burn their dead and seal the tombs of old kings with salt and iron.
## The Veiled Kingdom of Oron-Khâr
“The land beneath the mirage.”

A desert empire of salt and shimmer, ruled by a long-lived dynasty that claims descent from sky-serpents. Oron-Khâr is famed for its glass palaces, fire-oracles, and labyrinthine tomb-cities hidden beneath the dunes. Its noble houses are bound by ancient contracts inked in venom, and the practice of flesh-alchemy is both revered and feared.

Notable Faction: The [[Wyrm-Blooded]]—sorcerer-priests who drink dragon ichor and serve the [[Flame Unending]], a god said to be chained beneath the sand.
## The Weftwood
“The forest remembers the First Tongue. It is not your friend.”

A vast, tangled, primeval [[forest-arcane]] that refuses to be mapped. The Weftwood is older than the Gyre itself, full of ruins from forgotten ages. Paths shift when no one is watching. Trees bleed sap that sings. Beasts speak in riddles, and some humans go in and never return—except something wearing their face might. The Druids here are not kindly. They are custodians of old balances, and they judge without mercy.

Notable Faction: The [[Rootbound Circle]] - a druidic order whose members replace parts of themselves with bark, claw, or stone, becoming less human with each rite.
