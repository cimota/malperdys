The Charnel is a horror perpetrated by one of the early [[Shift]]-capable races. The [[Irisian|Irisians]] deny it was them. It is a mass-grave committed to the [[Shift]], with enough bodies and pain to generate its own [[Reality Meme (Onton)|onton]]. It roams the [[Shift]] and is the cause of many horrendous disasters when it strays too close to an existing [[Brane]]. Worse, it is attracted to murders and massacres and its influence magnifies the effects. 

The Charnel was formed by a massacre which was vented to the [[Shift]] to hide the evidence. As a result the information layer of the universe was tainted and it started to generate its own [[Darkness]], becoming an [[Reality Meme (Onton)|onton]] of itself. 

Approaching the Charnel will cause its victims to become obsessed with death, leading to violent, antisocial, sadistic and masochistic acts. It is highly recommended that it not be approached as a result.
