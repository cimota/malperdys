# Creating a Malperdys Adventurer in YZE

# Base Generation

## Attributes

### Vitality
Vitality is a catch-for physical attributes. This can be differentiated using Talents.
### Insight
Insight is a mix of perception, extra-sensory perception and intuition.
### Resolve
Resolve is the strength of mind, used for rendurance, determination and psychic power.

## Species and Culture

### Panhuman
Panhuman is the baseline which includes Humans, Atlanteans, Red Martians, Therns, Irisians

### Ghouls
Ghouls are non-human denizens of the Dreamlands. They are humanoid but possess many bestial features which exclude them from being described as Panhumans. 
### Serpent People
Serpent People pre-date humanity by millennia.
### Tharks
Tharks are large, non-human creatures from Barsoom who maintain a strong warrior culture, while they eschew most technology. They stand around 2.5 metres tall when fully grown and are easily identified by their multiple limbs (four arms, two legs), facial tusks and their mottled flesh being variations of green and brown.
### Giants
Giants are a humanoid species who are physically powerful and tower over most other species (even Tharks).

## Talents
Talents allow for differentiation from the norm. These do not cover supernatural abilities. Talents provide +1/+2 Shifts for rolls.

## Career
Examples: Shiftship Pilot, Magus, Privateer, Laputan Skysorcerer, Warrior

## Abilities
Some abilities will be gained from Species and Culture and should be added first. In many cases Abilities will add new ways to do things as well as eliminate penalties.

- Giant (Giants)
- Multi-Limbed (Tharks)

## Applying Archetype

## Household
The players may be able to form a [[The Malperdys House|Malperdys]] [[Household]] if they all have access to the house and hold an Ontonic Item.
