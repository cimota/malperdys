Magic in MALPERDYS is represented by the Eldritch. 

The Eldritch is the unwritten law of the impossible, the force that does not obey the known principles of causality, reason, or structured existence. Where [[Technology and Reality|Technology]] refines and [[Wonders]] inspire, the Eldritch intrudes - it is an anomaly, an aberration, a force that should not be but is. It does not have a singular origin; it is older than time and newer than the last breath spoken. Some believe it to be the whisper of forgotten deities, others the natural language of a reality deeper than our own. 

The Eldritch does not break rules - it reveals that the rules were never whole to begin with. It is the language of [[Sorcerors]], the fabric of forbidden places, the logic that bleeds in dreams and shadows. To wield the Eldritch is not to command, but to bargain, to reshape oneself as much as the world. It is the creeping dread of an entity knowing your name before you are born, the sensation of standing somewhere you have never been, but remembering it all the same. It is not measured, nor worshipped - it is invoked, and sometimes, it listens.
# Magic is Relative and Local
The rules for magic seldom remain the same across realities. While a traveller may carry enough of their home universe [[Echo]] for their magic to continue to work, it’s only a matter of time until [[Drift]] causes their magic to change, to fit in with the local paradigm.

It may also be that the inhabitants of a reality do not have access to magic, even though magic is possible within that [[Brane]]. 
# Magic and Technology
Some technology includes a component of magic. 

The [[Chronis Mechanism]], for instance, involves a magical organism, entrapped within a technological artefact in a symbiosis of organics, technology and magic. When attached to living flesh, it will prolong the wearers life indefinitely and give them prodigious healing abilities (though it is noted that the new flesh that is grown is smooth like marble).

The [[Penance Configuration]] is a magical portal, attached to an elaborate puzzle box with potentially hundreds of combinations. Each combination can, if completed at the right time, cause a [[chiasma]] between the two realities (limited to a radius of around 7 metres.) This allows entities from one side to enter the other and vice versa.
# Practitioners
There are as many names for those who work magic as there are cultures. In some cultures they are known as wizards or striges, in some sorcerers or bruja, in other witches, bokor or necromancers.
# YZE System Considerations
In the YZE, the effects of magic will be based on Successes, working with an effects table. 

There is an Action to be chosen with an appropriate cost. This cost must be paid before even the Impact, Time or Space is considered

Create - At least 3 successes is required for this.
Destroy - At least 1 success is required for this.
Move - at least 1 success is required for this.
Change - at least 1 success is required for this.

| Successes | Impact        | Time                          | Space                              |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 0         | No impact     | No time                       | No space or distance               |
| 1         |               | 1 turn or up to 12 seconds    | 1 cup or the space in a human hand |
| 2         |               | 1 Stretch or up to 12 minutes | 30-50 kilos or a human child       |
| 3         | Life or Death | 1 Shift or up to 12 hours     | A human-sized object or a human    |
| 4         |               | 1 Day or up to 24 hours       |                                    |
| 5         |               | 1 week                        |                                    |
| 6         |               | 1 month                       |                                    |
| 7         |               | 1 year                        |                                    |
| 8         |               | 100 years                     |                                    |
| 9         |               | Permanent                     |                                    |

Some conditions may enhance or limit successes.

e.g.

Certain times and places are more conducive to magic, therefore additional Successes may be available to the caster if they can Succeed in their Magic roll.

Some [[Brane|realities]] can be more or less accepting of magical effects depending on their particular rules. 

Some realities will exchange life for successes.
# Wytchery system and Chaos Dice
The Wytchery system (used in Matts homebrew for the the Witcher) is based on a Stat+Skill roll (Resolve+Casting) which usually provides up to 4 Successes in a competent sorcerer.
Each Spell requires a certain number of successes to achieve. But mages can do much better (depending on your point of view) using Chaos Dice.
e.g a sorcerer may be rolling d10 Resolve and d8 Casting for a spell. But they want a better chance of getting the result so they Push (using Chaos dice). PLayer decides to take on 4 Chaos dice to make sure.

# Cypher System Considerations

In Cypher, we're kinda spoiled for options. The vast majority of, "magical," characters can be represented by *Foci*. *It's Only Magic* introduces a good number of spellcasting specific ones along with descriptors and cantrips.

*Manifestation* introduces the concept of Aspects, which might be more appropriate in some instances.

*See also [[The Sorcerer]]*

## [Todash Space](https://darktower.fandom.com/wiki/Todash_Space)
A void that exists between worlds. It is entirely dark and is filled with monsters.
