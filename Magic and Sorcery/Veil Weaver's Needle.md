This artifact is a needle of pure obsidian that seems to vibrate slightly when held. It allows its user to, "stitch," gaps between dimensions, either sealing rifts or creating new pathways. The stitching process produces threads of an ephemeral, silver-like substance that fade over time, requiring constant maintenance. However, misuse of the needle risks unravelling not just dimensions, but the user’s very existence.

Rumours claim the needle is one of a pair: its twin being capable of completely severing dimensional ties. Both are [[Ontonic Objects|Ontonic Items]].
