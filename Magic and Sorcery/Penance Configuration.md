The Penance Configuration is a notorious [[Ontonic Item|Ontonic relic]]: a heavy puzzle-box of black iron and silver wire, its surface etched with shifting geometries that never remain the same from one glance to the next. The box possesses potentially hundreds of solutions, each set of movements and alignments forming a different, "combination". Most result in nothing more than a sour vibration in the air, but a handful, when completed at the right conjunction of time and place, trigger a [[Chiasma|chiasma]]; a local tearing of reality limited to a radius of 6.72 metres.

Within the [[Chiasma|chiasma]], the walls between adjacent [[Branes|branes]] thin, and entities may pass freely between them. Spirits, [[Reality Meme (Onton)|Ontonic]] [[Echo|echoes]], and even fragments of architecture sometimes spill through, while mortals on either side can glimpse or cross into the other world. The effect lasts only minutes, though its consequences can endure far longer: wounds carry across realities, possessions may be misplaced in the wrong world, and some who pass through find their reflections altered thereafter.

The Configuration is both portal and prison. Its name derives from its most feared function: the box may be offered to a supplicant who seeks forgiveness. Should they solve it, unaware of which combination they pursue; they risk opening a [[Chiasma|chiasma]] that admits things eager to punish, devour, or remake them. [[Malperdys]] records suggest entire [[Malperdys#Households|Households]] have been undone by a single ill-timed twist of the box.
# In Play
- Activating the Configuration requires solving a complex riddle or puzzle; each attempt carries risk.
- A successful alignment produces a chiasma, creating temporary passage.
- A failed attempt may attract unwanted attention from across the veil.
- Repeated use destabilises local reality, making future crossings more violent.

> [!Note] d6: Manifestations of the Penance Configuration
>
> 1. The Candle-Bearer - A tall, robed figure with a candle where its face should be. It offers light that banishes shadows, but each hour it burns, a memory of the [[Malperdys#Households|Household]] is lost.
> 2. The Vein-Cats - Sleek, ash-furred felines with glowing red lines running under their skin. They are friendly and protective, but their presence draws the attention of predators from across the [[Shift]].
> 3. The Glass Door - A freestanding doorway of translucent glass that appears within the radius. It can be opened once, leading to a room or corridor from another reality; often useful, sometimes lethal.
> 4. The Salt Rain - A localised storm pours down sharp crystals of salt. Wounds inflicted under it do not heal until the storm ceases. However, the salt purges corruption and poisons from flesh.
> 5. The Regretful Choir - A dozen translucent figures drift into view, each singing a wordless dirge. They may answer one question truthfully but afterward, they attach themselves to a [[Malperdys#Households|Household]] member, haunting them with whispered accusations.
> 6. The Iron Hand - A disembodied gauntlet of black steel emerges, crawling like a spider. If seized, it fuses to the bearer, granting immense strength. But the hand has its own will, and sometimes acts against its host.
