A rare [[Ontonic Objects|Ontonic relic]], the Chronis Mechanism is a fusion of [[Magic|magical]] organism and [[Technology and Reality|technological]] artifice, bound together in an uneasy symbiosis of biology, circuitry, and spell-craft. The device resembles a clockwork heart threaded with translucent veins, always faintly warm and pulsing. When grafted to living flesh, it rewrites the bearer's mortality, granting indefinite longevity and prodigious healing. Wounds close within moments, organs renew, and even fatal trauma can be reversed given time. Yet the flesh that regrows is unnervingly perfect: smooth, pale, and cold to the touch, like marble carved into the semblance of skin. Those who carry the Mechanism often appear flawless, ageless statues of themselves, but they whisper of other prices; of dreams that no longer come, of appetites dulled, and of an echoing tick that follows them through every passage of the [[Malperdys|House]].
