At first glance, this delicate, bone-white circlet appears to grant immense power and influence over others, allowing its wearer to bend weaker minds to their will. However, with each use, the crown siphons fragments of the wearer’s soul, hollowing them out emotionally and physically. Over time, the wearer becomes a mindless husk while the crown begins speaking with their voice, perpetuating its influence and control across dimensions.
