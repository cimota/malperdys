This pulsating, inky purple crystal seems alive, faintly beating like a heart. It grants its possessor the ability to summon shadow entities from other dimensions to do their bidding. However, these shadows extract a heavy toll—they demand the user's most cherished memories in return for their service. The user forgets loved ones, triumphs, and even their own identity, becoming a hollow fragment of who they once were. Worse yet, the shadows grow stronger and harder to control the more they’re summoned.

Some theorize that the Heart is not a crystal at all, but the petrified remains of a dark god’s heart, still faintly alive and seeding corruption across realms. As an [[Ontonic Objects|Ontonic Item]], it will be pursued by [[Archivists]]
