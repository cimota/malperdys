This is a lost medieval Arabic manuscript from the 15th century. The manuscript is a hunter's guide noted for its mention of the [[Zerzura]] oasis. The author and exact dating of the manuscript are unknown. It lists over four hundred sites in Egypt that hold hidden treasure and details the incantations needed to ward off the evil spirits who guard said treasures.

The guide provides a specific plan for obtaining the treasure without alerting the royalty, which includes retrieving the key from a unique location to access the wealth. This allows the hunter to avoid any danger or complications that may arise from encountering the King and Queen directly.

>"Go to the Sphinx and measure from its face south-east twelve Maliki cubits, that is to say, each a cubit and a half of the greatest cubit. Search there and you will find two mastabas of stone and stones scattered around them. Dig between the two mastabas about a man's height, and you will find a plate (? flagstone). Clear it from sand well, and raise it and pass to the door which is the door of the Great Pyramid. Cross the threshold of the door and beware of the wells on the right and left, which are closed wells. Pass straight on and take no notice of the wells, and you will find in the breast (front) of the wall a great stone (? turning). Open it and pass on, and you will see many cells on the right and left, and before your face a great cell with the (great) king of the former kings of Egypt, and kings with him and his son, around him, wearing their kingly robes adorned with gold and silver, and you will see their treasures and their emeralds, and pearls and ornaments of gold and silver...."
