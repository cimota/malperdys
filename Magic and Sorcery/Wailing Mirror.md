This cracked, obsidian mirror constantly whispers unintelligible chants, growing louder the closer one approaches. When gazed into, it shows the viewer's greatest regret, but in a version where they made an even worse decision. The mirror tempts the viewer to reach inside and alter their past, but each time someone does, a shadow of them is left trapped within the mirror. Over time, the trapped souls form a malevolent consciousness that seeks to shatter the boundary between the mirror and the physical world.

Forged in the depths of a dimension where regret manifests as tangible energy, the mirror was cursed by a betrayed oracle seeking revenge on all who ignore consequences. This is an [[Ontonic Objects|Ontonic Item]].
