A Geas is a magical compulsion or binding command placed upon an individual by a higher power (and on [[Earth-40]] through the [[Dragons Breath]]). 

A Geas is a mystical law woven into the [[soul]] - those under Geas are compelled to act (or to refrain from acting) under the terms of the binding. Disobedience has severe consequences; from physical torment and mental suffering to a complete unmaking of the self. It is often tied to specific fates/dooms.

Geasa may be:
- **Commands** - “You shall not speak the truth to a king”
- **Restrictions** - “You may never cross running water”
- **Obligations** - “You must answer every cry for help”

While it may not be visible to others, an individual **knows** when they are under the influence of a geas and certainly knows when they are in violation. In some cases, fulfilling the *spirit* of a geas rather than the *letter* may be possible. Only the entity which places the geas or one of greater power may undo it.
# Examples
## The Bound King
Rules for seventy-seven years without ever speaking a lie; his reign was bound by a geas to preserve truth in all things.
## The Silent Saint
Took a geas of silence as penance for crimes in a previous life and to reward his duty, he was able to perform [[Wonders]].
## The Black Oath
A trap for overconfident knights meaning they will never retreat in battle. Few live beyond the age of forty.
