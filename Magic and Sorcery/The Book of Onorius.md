Written in 1512, this book contains lists of demons and the means to summon and bind them. The demons listed are mostly non-existent in any reality, but there is reference to the [[Endless Things]], including [[Nehemoth]] (Causality, Regret, Consequence), [[Veyloth]] (Obfuscation and Fragmentation), [[Khal’Zuun]] (Entropy, Decay, Collapse) and [[Iskryth]] (repetition, Obsession and Recursion).

A copy resides safely in the [[Invisible College#Library|Library]] at the [[Invisible College]].
