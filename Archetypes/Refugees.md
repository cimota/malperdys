The last survivors of dying worlds and failing realities who have, through luck or design, found themselves in a new universe. They are [[Unanchored]] and therefore subject to [[Drift]].

Refugees carry the pain of the loss of their reality but as they are still part of the reality, the [[Echo]] of that reality (even though it is entirely deleted) is enough to reconstitute an entire universe from their matter.
