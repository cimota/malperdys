*Cerunos, Irisian Disruptor. Imprisoned for the Finality of the Continuum of Dragons*

Disruptors are protagonists who wish to sever the links between universes and allow them to develop in their own fashion. 

They may have other roles but they fervently believe that the multiverse is best served with not as much cross-pollination. That the reason it’s so difficult to move between the different realities is to prevent contamination. Paradoxically, Disruptors may use this technology to cross between realities in the service of their desire to see the transit eventually cease.

Disruptors often come from [[Chars]] and are themselves [[Refugees]]. The realities they are trying to save are not always their own. These are, by default, [[Unanchored]].
