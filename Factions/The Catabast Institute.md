The Catabast Institute does not exist on any one world. Like the shadowed bazaars where shiftship smugglers hawk contraband from a million branes, the Institute is a traveling conspiracy, setting up temporary “Faculties” in abandoned observatories, repurposed vaults, or ruined libraries. Their symbol — a descending staircase that spirals into nothing — is etched discreetly where only initiates know to look.
# Origins
The Institute began, or so its legends claim, with a single [[Irisian]]. He was a functionary once, one of the grey-cloaked caretakers of the early [[Shiftship]] routes. His name is lost, erased even from [[Irisian]] archives, but the story says he watched too long at the seam lines between [[Brane|branes]] and began to ask the wrong questions.

He noticed patterns. Cargoes that decayed when carried across certain membranes. Languages that gained new meanings when spoken too near the [[Shift]]. [[Reality Meme (Onton)|Ontons]] that proliferated like contagions, yet resisted measurement.

When his superiors dismissed him, he descended. Into ruins. Into arcane mathematics. Into conversations with things glimpsed in the folds of reality. He founded the first Faculty in an abandoned fortress-prison, where inmates and scholars alike were subjected to endless questioning until the last of their illusions cracked. From those broken minds, the Catabast Institute was born.
# Philosophy
The Institute teaches one central doctrine: “Every structure is built upon a lie. To find the root is to descend.”

The Catabast Institute applies its skepticism to the multiverse itself. They believe: Each [[Brane|brane]] is a mask. [[Shiftship|Shiftships]] travel not through space, but through veils of falsehood. [[Reality Meme (Onton)|Ontons]] are not building blocks of reality, but errors propagated by the [[Irisian]] experiment.

The Institute's work is therefore not to discover, "truth," in any comforting sense, but to dig downward until the fabric of deception is pierced. Most who descend are destroyed, but to the Institute, that destruction is proof of progress.
# Structure
Unlike religious cults or criminal syndicates, the Catabast Institute has no singular hierarchy. It organizes itself in Faculties — cells of five to fifteen members, each devoted to a particular descent. Some study languages, others living cargo, others the mathematics of [[Shift]] routes.

Each Faculty maintains a Refuter, chosen not for leadership but for their skill at interrogation. The Refuter's role is to dismantle the arguments of their fellows until nothing remains but the descent itself. No Faculty can survive long without a Refuter; without constant internal refutation, they risk drifting into dogma.

Faculties rarely meet in person. More often they exchange refutation letters, bundles of arguments and counter-arguments written in triple ciphers, smuggled along with ordinary cargo. A Faculty that cannot withstand the questions of others is dissolved, its members forced deeper into the descent or abandoned as, "Failed".
# Methods
The Institute’s tools are not swords or spells but questions, paradoxes, and exposures.
## Interrogation
Initiates are broken through days of questioning. They are forced to explain contradictions in their own beliefs until collapse, then re-forged as Catabasts.
## Refutative Rituals
Through dialectic chants and paradoxical sigils, they unpick not only ideas but phenomena. A Faculty once “debated” a binding ward until the spirit it contained unraveled into smoke.
## Smuggled Truths
They purchase or steal cargoes of strange matter, not for profit but for examination. A barrel of worms that whispers in [[Rajyapura]], a cracked mask from [[Xiángguó́]] that cries when worn, a tongue of fire that does not burn. All are tested, refuted, broken open for the descent.

The Catabasts reject permanence. Once a Faculty concludes a descent — whether through discovery or ruin — they burn their notes and scatter. Another Faculty, somewhere else, picks up the descent afresh.
# Reputation
Among smugglers and [[Malperdys]] traders, the Institute is spoken of in half-whispers. Some call them philosophical parasites, attaching themselves to expeditions until nothing is left but doubt. Others trade with them willingly, for their questions can unravel magical wards and bureaucratic lies alike.

To governments, the Catabasts are subversives of the highest order. No dogma can withstand their questioning: not imperial law, not divine decree, not even [[Irisian]] memory.

The [[Irisian|Irisians]] themselves loathe them most of all. To an [[Irisian]], the Catabasts are vandals of the multiverse, gnawing at the very foundations the [[Irisian|Irisians]] constructed. But the [[Irisian|Irisians]] are too diminished to eradicate them. Faculties thrive in the shadows of ports and black markets, tolerated because they are too useful to fully destroy.
# Symbols & Language
The Institute uses layered symbols. The most common is the descending staircase, always spiraling leftward, etched in chalk or paint where meetings are held. Another is the mirror cracked vertically, representing the break between what is shown and what is concealed.

Their language is a patchwork of tongues: fragments of [[Irisian]] notation, [[Balnibarbi|Balnibarban]] mantras, [[Nibiru|Nibiran]] pictograms, and smuggler cant. Their ciphers are deliberately paradoxical — sentences that contradict themselves but still convey meaning to initiates.
# A Meeting of the Catabasts
To an outsider stumbling into a Faculty meeting, it would look like chaos: a circle of scholars, smugglers, ascetics, all arguing at once. One insists that the [[Brane|branes]] are alive. Another refutes that they are dead. A third insists the truth is irrelevant. Voices rise until the Refuter cuts through with a paradox that shatters the debate entirely.

There is no resolution. Only descent.

At the end of the night, their chalk diagrams are smeared, their arguments burned, their questions carried forward. Nothing remains but the sense of a trapdoor opening beneath them all.
# Dangers
The Catabast Institute is dangerous not because of armies or weapons, but because of what it leaves behind: Faiths broken. Institutions hollowed. Travelers doubting the ground they walk upon.

More than one Faculty has disappeared entirely — swallowed by their own descent. Sometimes what they uncovered was too great to endure. Sometimes the [[The Extant Maw|Maw]] of a refuted world swallowed them whole.

And yet new Faculties always emerge, because the hunger for descent is contagious.
# The Fear
Whispered in [[Malperdys]] marketplaces is the greatest fear: that the Institute will eventually refute the [[Shift]] itself. That they will dig so deep into the contradictions of travel, smuggling, and brane contact that the seams will come undone. And then all the cargoes, all the worlds, all the fragile veils will collapse into a single screaming descent.

The Catabasts smile when this fear is voiced. For them, that collapse is not doom but fulfillment.

"To descend is to free," their motto runs. "To free is to fall. To fall is to arrive".
