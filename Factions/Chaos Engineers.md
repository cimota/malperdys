The Chaos Engineers style themselves privateers of the [[Shift|Second Aether]], preying on the oppressive forces of the tyrannical [[Singularity]], in their nimble, well armed [[Shiftship|shiftships]]. [[Factions#GeneriCorp|GeneriCorp]] transports are a particular favourite of the freewheeling Chaos Engineers, but their mercurial, some might say aberrant, behaviour often defies what passes for common logic.

It would not be uncommon to see a [[Factions#GeneriCorp|GeneriCorp]] transport outfitted with [[Radium Rifles|Radium guns]] from [[Barsoom]], cannon from [[Balnibarbi]] and [[Lightning Guns]] from [[Yuggoth]].

The origin species of the Chaos Engineers trends to the [[Human]] [[Reality Meme (Onton)|onton]] but their individual nature may be very different with some of them possessing animal, plant and mineral hybridisation. Some may even be [[Irisian]], horrified by their own history of destroying entire universes at a whim.

The Chaos Engineers are, for some reason, prevented from joining a [[The Malperdys House|Malperdys]] [[Household]]. This may be the result of a sin of violence committed in the past or in the future.
