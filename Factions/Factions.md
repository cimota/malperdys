# [[Tenet of Indeterminate Philosophy]]
Civil service investigators, archivists, occultists and spies maintaining the *status quo* across the multiverse.
# [[Tindalean Lords]]
A cross between Gallifrey and Amber.
# [[TransWorld Authority]]
An upstart org of dimensional police.
# [[Irisian|Irisians]]
The architects of the [[Shiftship|Shiftships]] and advanced multiverse science, hailing from the [[Brane|Hypervolume]]. Irisians have the technology to not only bring a universe to Finality but also seed a Beginning (without the need for a [[Ekpyrotic Genesis]]). Irisians themselves have their own sub-factions considering the slow decline of their civilisation. 
- The [[Architects]] generally take pride in their work and seek to extend connections and construct new [[Reality Meme (Onton)|Ontons]] 
- they are the origin of the [[Disruptors]], with some believing that the multiverse-experiment has gone on too long.
- Going further than this, the [[Severants]] believe that the multiverse is a mess of paradoxes and abominations and seek to close it all down to a singular reality.
- The [[Caretakers]] have self-appointed as guardians of what they condescendingly call the Upstarts (any species they believe is not as old or evolved as them).
- The Chroniclers are the core [[Reality Meme (Onton)|onton]] for the [[Archivists]]
- [[Prismatics]] possibly are the [[Reality Meme (Onton)|onton]] for the [[Chaos Engineers]].
# [[Fallen Lords]]
Think of these as the previous rulers of dead dimensions. Maybe like the lords in TORG. Looking to copy their dimension across another and give it new life.
-  [[Sarnash, Serpent Lord]]: ruler of the [[Serpent People]] of [[Hyperborea]]
-  [[Lord Varnae]]: Domain of [[Dread]]
-  [[The King in Yellow]]
- [[The Sorcerer]] of [[The Emerald City]]
- [[The Necromancer of Zothique]]
# [[Abysson]], a [[Monad Group Corporation]]
Abysson is a corporation trading in the US and Europe, headquartered in Leipzig, Germany. Abysson is a prominent name in high energy absorption materials and happened upon a new process which, in breaking the laws of physics, opened a literal door to a pocket dimension. They have spent a considerable amount of time building out the pocket dimension mathematically, to the point they have several billion square metres of banal office space and warehousing "offshored" to the "[[Places/Abysson Space|Abysson Space]]". These vast facilities they can rent out with minimal outlay using much smaller buildings. The Monad Group Corporation is also responsible for [[The Extant Maw]], [[The Mawborn]] and [[The Swarm]]; or is it the other way round. 
# [[GeneriCorp]]
A corporation which has found a way in and is expanding, taking advantage of different universal rules. Like when the East India Company found its way into Narnia. They took advantage of the rapid progression of time (and how humans were immune to its ravages) and were able to boost productivity - entire seasons of farming and manufacture available in minutes.
# [[Singularity]]
The tyrannical opposition to the [[Chaos Engineers]].
