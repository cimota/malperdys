The Singularity views the so-called [[Chaos Engineers]] as little more than erratic disruptors, anarchists cloaking themselves in the guise of privateers to justify their reckless defiance of order. They skulk through the unstable currents of the [[Shift|Second Aether]], striking at vital [[Factions#GeneriCorp|GeneriCorp]] convoys with their illicitly modified [[Shiftship|Shiftships]] twisted relics of stolen technology, wielded without respect for its true potential. To them, resistance is a game, their actions dictated by impulse rather than strategy. Their unpredictability is not ingenuity but malfunction, a flaw in the system that must inevitably be corrected.
