Humanity is an [[Reality Meme (Onton)|Onton]]; that is to say a reality meme which has influenced the development of intelligent species across billions of realities. This is why so many entities encountered across the realities develop a human shape. Even the humans of [[Earth]], from their earliest evolution, were patterned as Humans due to the influence (via [[Multiverse/Darkness|Darkness]]) of the Human [[Reality Meme (Onton)|Onton]]. 

In some realities, Human shaped entities may be combined with Lizards (See [[Places/Jiboor|Jiboor]], [[Serpent People]]) or plants or minerals.

Changes to the Human physiognomy will be due to local effects or the [[Darkness]] from other exterior influences.
