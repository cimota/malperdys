# Ghouls
Ghouls are a distasteful, ugly humanoid race of cannibals who also represent one evolutionary path for humanity. Through an ill-documented process, humans can turn into a ghoul - gaining immortality and ghoul-telepathy - at the cost of humanity and consisting of a diet of corpse-flesh for the rest of your days. 

While humans might see ghouls as a degenerate race, with canine-like fanged snouts and rear legs more reminiscent of a kangaroo than a human, ghouls have a highly evolved society and a reverence for memory. Ghoul telepathy only works with the minds of those they consume -  where they place the memories into their own minds to be recounted around their fires. 

Whereas a human might wonder what happens after death, a ghoul knows that their feasting tables are the first step but that the memories of the deceased will live on forever; for as long as that ghoul still breathes.

Ghouls possess curved needle-like claws on their fingers and their teeth are well suited for a meat-based diet. Their flesh is grey and rubbery and individuals may be identified by the patterning of thick hair and coloured patches on their skin. Ghoul speech is surprisingly high pitched for a creature of their size and the sounds of them meeping and gibbering amongst their kin can be  disquieting, but perhaps not half as worrisome as a lullaby sung to their young. Ghoul sets are often untidy caverns, littered with gnawed bones and with the overpowering stench of rotting meat and excrement; some ghouls maintain tidy homes and tremendous libraries. their access to memory provides them with great learning and teaching skills.

Ghouls also possess a special connection to the [[Dreamlands]], much like [[Humans]], but also stronger in ways due to their connection with memory. Humans enter at will, but only during sleep. Ghouls can enter the Dreamlands physically and take objects and people back and forth. 

Ghouls will not tend to be aggressive against intruders, especially well-armed humans. They will attempt to flee if challenged as they believe they carry the prize of human memories in their minds. Their death would therefore be the death of those minds they hold. 
While Ghouls are distasteful, they're not evil. They only eat the dead and have no predatory instinct. They're not cruel, nor do they delight in the mastery of others. They're simply a consequence of their time. A Ghoul ally would be powerful, not only in terms of their physical ability and magic, but their ability to travel into the Dreamlands.

## Ghoul Abilities:

**Dreamlands Travel** - a Ghoul can open the pathway to the Dreamlands and can take objects and humans with them. This requires complete darkness and a Stretch of preparation for a journey that will last a Shift.
**Summon Swarm** - Ghouls can summon hordes of rats. This is not a supernatural ability and requires the presence of rats (not usually a problem in urban environments) as well as the ability to speak.
