  - Gnomes of the Gyre
---
*“The future is written in soot, brass, and blood.”*

Small in stature but vast in ambition, the Gnomes of the [[Gyre]] are a secretive and fiercely intelligent people, best known for their mastery of engineering, alchemy, and dangerous innovation. To outsiders, they are tinkerers and misfits. To those who’ve seen their weapons detonate or watched a World Pivot bloom open like a mechanical flower, instant and precise, they are terrifying gods of invention.

Gnomes dwell in hidden enclaves beneath mountains, within deep gorges, or in cities built inside decommissioned engines of war. Their architecture is angular, metallic, and alive with steam, pistons, and blinking alchemical lights. Gnomes do not build with beauty in mind—they build to function, and that function is often explosive.

# Technology and Artifice
Gnomes are the undisputed masters of technomancy, a crude but potent marriage of alchemy and mechanism. They are the only known race to harness gunpowder with precision, and their devices range from handheld flare pistols and grenado spheres to siege-class thunder-ram mortars. Even kings who ban magic will hire Gnomish sappers for their ability to crack stone, unseat towers, or collapse tunnels with chilling efficiency.

Their greatest achievement is the [[World Pivots and Keyed Glyphs | World Pivot]]; a ringed construct of brass and rune-etched stone capable of instant matter transmission between distant sites. Though the science behind it is tightly guarded, it is known that World Pivots respond only to Keyed Glyphs; engineered sigils that “tune” the destination like a lock selecting a tumbler. Pivots function reliably only when intact and maintained… but some say damaged or corrupted ones can scatter travelers into the Blind Realms.

Blasting Charges: Alchemical satchels of compacted dust and dragon's salt. Used to tunnel, breach, or erase problems.

Grenado Spheres: Cast-iron orbs with primed fuses—filled with blackdust, caltrops, or vapor poison. Terrifying in war.

Spring-Fist Gauntlets: Mechanical gloves that use compressed ether to deliver bone-breaking punches. Favored by dueling engineers.

# Mindset and Culture
To a Gnome, invention is worship. They do not keep gods, they build better things. Every enclave is a loud, smoky workshop-temple, filled with argument, experimentation, and creative rivalry. Elders are revered for the patents they’ve filed, not the years they’ve lived. Young Gnomes are apprenticed early and risk disfigurement or death in pursuit of breakthrough.

Their culture is pragmatic to the point of cruelty. They do not mourn the dead if it means progress. They archive everything. They do not tolerate waste. Their legal system is based entirely on intellectual property theft and unauthorized disassembly; two crimes considered worse than murder.

# The Gilded Accord
Centuries ago, Gnomes nearly destroyed themselves in a civil war known as the Forgefire Schism, when rival enclaves unleashed experimental doomsday engines in a dispute over piston threading standards. Since then, they’ve operated under the Gilded Accord, a fragile agreement that limits the production of megascale weapons and mandates the sharing of Pivot schematics, at least in theory.

In truth, most enclaves jealously guard their work and sabotage rivals when possible. The Accord is a fiction, and everyone knows it.

# Appearance and Physiology
Gnomes average four feet in height, with wiry builds and eyes adapted to low-light detail. Their skin is often stained with soot, oil, or alchemical burns, and many augment themselves with prosthetic limbs, spinal braces, or ocular lenses. Gnomes live fast lives, few reach old age, but those who do are encased in support-rigs of their own invention.

They rarely breed, and often modify their young to “improve” mental acuity or dexterity. More than one Gnomish genius was built, not born.
