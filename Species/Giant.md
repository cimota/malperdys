Giants are any Human-shape being which exceeds the standard deviation for size from the [[Human]] [[Reality Meme (Onton)|Onton]] - this usually results in human-appearing individuals who may be 3-4 metres in height with few common morbidities.

The “gigantism” does not extend to creatures outside the Onton and therefore it may be challenging to find suitable mounts, for example. Buildings for giants may present difficulties for standard humans and vice versa
