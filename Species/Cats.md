# The Cats

> “We go where the moons rise, and none may close a door against us.”

## Nature
The Cats are not a bloodline but a fellowship of wanderers, dream-born and free. They are the silver-eyed felines of the [[Dreamlands]], but they travel the [[Shift]] as easily as they walk a garden wall.

## Boons

Members of the Cat Household receive:

- Dream-Walking: Once per voyage, they may pass into the Dreamlands to find a hidden path, shortcut, or refuge. These [[Moon paths]] can bypass most defences.
- Ninefold Escape: They gain uncanny resilience; the first time they would perish or be utterly defeated, fortune twists and they slip free.
- Moon’s Favour: In places touched by moonlight, they may speak with animals or receive fragments of secret knowledge.

## Geasa (Obligations)

To remain in the Household, members must abide by the following:
- Never betray a secret freely entrusted.
- Never harm the sleeping — be they friend, foe, or beast.
- Never name the hidden road by which you travel.

## Enemies & Rivals

The Cats are despised by the gaolers of the multiverse — Lineages that demand fealty, Houses that bind their vassals with iron law. To them, the Cats are disorder, the crack through which freedom seeps. Yet the wise keep a bowl of milk at their door, for to be marked as foe of the Cats is to sleep without safety.
