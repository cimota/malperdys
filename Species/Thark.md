A species of Green skinned [[Giant]] on Barsoom.

Tharks stand 3-4 metres tall when fully grown. They are most notable for their height, their six limbs (4 arms, 2 legs) and the tusks which grow from the faces of mature specimens.

# Technology
Tharks have not progressed past tribal technology though they have adopted [[Radium Rifles]] with gusto. Tharks express distaste at the thought of using a Flier, but can be convinced of the utility of flight in the Barsoom expanses.
