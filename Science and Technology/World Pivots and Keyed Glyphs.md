**World Pivots** are a convenient way to travel between locations (and even realities). The [[Technology|technology]] to create them resides solely within the, "[[Gnomes]]," faction.

World Pivots are a new marvel of [[Gnomes|Gnomish]] invention; gleaming, humming inventions that connect distant points across the [[Gyre]] (world, continent, multiverse) through instantaneous spatial folding. Built atop existing leyline junctions or geomagnetic anomalies, each **Pivot** is a precision-engineered portal array activated via **Keyed Glyphs** and governed by semi-autonomous scheduling routines.
Designed by the eccentric technocrat [[Gorwyn Knurlbrace]] and his syndicate of [[Iridomechanics]], the Pivots are intended to revolutionize trade, diplomacy, and mobility... though they are not without quirks.

Gnomish invention has not yet used the World Pivot to access the [[Shift]] or other worlds across the [[Shift]], but this may be just a matter of time.

They provide a safer alternative to [[Sothothian Gate Spheres]].
# Functionality
**Keyed Glyphs** are brass-carved, rune-tuned tokens (often worn as amulets or rings) that align the Pivot to a specific destination node.

**Spontaneous Activations occur during:**
- High celestial alignment (solstice, eclipse)
- Residual energy spikes (massive magic use nearby)
- Random firmware faults (thanks, [[Gnomes]])
# Rules of Operation
**Outbound Travel is Reliable.**
If the World Pivot is undamaged, powered, and you have the correct Keyed Glyph, you will be transported instantly and safely to the designated destination Pivot.

**Each Glyph Is One-Way.**
Glyphs are encoded per Pivot destination, not return.

**Returning requires either:**
- A different Glyph to that specific departure point,
- Access to a local Glyph stockpile, or
- Use of unstable methods (see below).

**Glyphs Are Rare and Controlled.**
- Most are owned by Gnomish guilds, merchant consortiums, or clandestine operatives.
- Black market glyphs exist, but many are corrupted, one-use, or forged with uncertain destinations.
- Pivot Travel Logs Exist.
- Gnomes can audit recent travel history, but only if the Pivot was functioning properly and records weren’t tampered with.

**No Telepathy, No Transit.**
Unlike magical portals, Pivots cannot respond to intent, thought, or ritual. Only glyph encoding matters.

**Aesthetic and Construction**

Runic pylons surrounding the platform click and shift, inscribed with changeable glyphs and infused with trace magical circuits (visible as glowing filaments).
Activation emits a brief harmonic hum followed by a flash of blue-gold light, and then a pressurized snap of displaced air.
# Game Use
Pivots can be used to get around the world, but only if:
- The right Glyph is in hand
- The destination is stable and unlocked
- The window is open (active period or overridden manually)
# Plot Hooks
- Sabotage or theft of a Glyph
- Players arrive... but it's not the version of the location they expected
- A Pivot activates on its own, drawing someone or something through
- The party gets sent to a remote ruin... and their glyph back is missing, stolen, or fake.
- A noble gives them a one-way glyph as payment but they must earn the return glyph on arrival.
- A faction controls a major Pivot hub, charging extortionate glyph fees unless you're aligned with them.
- A broken Pivot might still activate, but the destination is unknown or warped.
- Characters will hoard, steal, and trade glyphs.
- Custom glyph cases are carried by diplomats and spies.
- Some glyphs are booby-trapped or cause delays.
# Requirements
To forge a glyph, a character needs:
- Tools: Gnomish engraving kit, lens array, conductive inks, or esoteric materials.
- Workspace: Secure environment (e.g., lab, workshop, hidden forge).
- Reference: Existing glyph (intact or damaged), glyph matrix shard, or decoded destination coordinates.
- Skill Check: Lore + Insight plus the Artificer talent as a minimum.

## Forging Difficulty

| Glyph Type            | Difficulty [**Cypher**] | Required Materials                    | Notes                                     |     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --- |
| Duplicate Known Glyph | 1  [Diff 3]             | Access to full original               | Most reliable                             |     |
| Modify Known Glyph    | 2  [Diff 4]             | Original + target matrix segment      | May cause instability                     |     |
| Forge from Fragments  | 3  [Diff 5]             | Two or more partial glyphs or records | May cause drift                           |     |
| Invent Custom Glyph   | 4+ [Diff 6]             | Glyph theory + raw materials          | May never work... or open to unknown site |     |

A failure means the glyph does not function. A success with a complication (rolling 1s) means the glyph works—but…

## Glyph Forging Complications (Roll d6 per 1 rolled)

| d6  | Complication                                                                     |     |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| 1   | Glyph is unstable – must roll every use or misfire                               |     |
| 2   | Static Charge – zaps user (1 Harm) when activated                                |     |
| 3   | Reversal – the glyph returns to you after use                                    |     |
| 4   | Drift – lands within 1–3 zones of target Pivot                                   |     |
| 5   | Scatter – more than one person travelling means they're scattered geographically |     |
| 6   | Echo – every activation attracts a monster nearby                                |     |

## Talent Synergies

- "Glyphwright" Talent: You may reroll 1 die during glyph crafting rolls.
- "Pivot Thief" Talent: When handling unknown glyphs, you roll +1 Step
- "Void-Touched" Talent: You can forge glyphs with partial matrices or fragments only. However, complications are rolled twice and you must choose one.
