# The Lost Atlas of Malperdys
## Description
The Atlas is not a book but a bundle of mismatched folios, each leaf a different size, language, and medium. Some are vellum etched with Irisian runes, others are printed broadsheets, others still look like chalk rubbings of walls that no longer exist. The bundle is held together by a tarnished ring clasp in the shape of the Serpent Crossing, though the serpent’s head has been filed away. When opened, the pages refuse order: they shuffle, rotate, or seem to vanish until another page is turned. This is the only reference to [[Malperdys]]
## Contents
### The Garden Folio
A sketch of a courtyard full of statues. Marginalia in red ink: “No statues here. They moved when I closed my eyes.”
> This is a warning that there is a [[Gorgon]] within the House.
### The Spiral Chart
A labyrinth drawn as a spiral galaxy, annotated with times instead of rooms (“19 minutes to the Library, 3 hours to the Kitchens”).
> These timings are accurate for the person following this chart.
### The Scales Page
Ink-blot diagrams resembling balance scales, one side weighted with a feather, the other with a door. Beneath, the note: “Do not enter when the weight is wrong.”
### The Fugue Leaf
A score of music with corridors marked instead of notes. When played, the melody seems to summon the faint smell of burning wood and damp stone. While the music plays, listeners are able to understand the weorkings and layout of the House.
> To play the Fugue requires a special instrument, perhaps the **Pipe** from the Drawing Room or the **Grand Pianoforte**.
### The Ontonic Map
A translucent sheet of volitive matter that adheres to skin. While held, the bearer feels a subtle pull toward the nearest inhabited room of the House. If removed, the sheet crumbles into dust. It will reappear within the Atlas at some random interval.
# Peculiarities
The Atlas cannot be copied. Attempts to trace its lines yield blank paper.

Reading it too intently may cause the House itself to notice the reader, often manifesting as a door that wasn’t there a moment before. The door may lead home or to another realm.

The Atlas is never in the same place twice. It drifts, appearing in dressing rooms, libraries, or even under a guest’s pillow. Some believe the House offers it when it wants residents to leave.
# In Play
> [!Rules]- Using the Atlas (YZE)
> Using the Atlas acts as a Pushed Roll in YZE when searching for a specific type of room with a Bane indicating the House has taken a dislike to the PC for the moment and may present a dangerous door. The House delivers the reader somewhere perilous or uncanny.

> [!Rules]- Using the Atlas (AME)
> Using the Atlas as normal, but the difficulty number is raised 1 point to 6.


Possessing the Atlas makes a character more likely to be adopted as a, "Resident," but also more likely to be stalked by [[Ontonic Objects|Ontonic]] ghosts of the [[Malperdys]] lineage.
