A vessel built to traverse the [[Shift]] between worlds. Characterised by their large sails that catch the [[Aethyric Winds]].

The vast silver and golden sails are the most striking feature of the shiftships. These sails ripple like liquid, reflecting the strange, swirling energies of the [[Shift]]. Their surfaces might appear smooth yet iridescent, changing colour subtly as they catch the dimensional winds. They unfurl gracefully, resembling sheets of molten metal, and their forms might even shift slightly, responding to the emotions of the crew or the nature of the current.

The ships feature open decks, exposed to the surreal environment of the [[Shift]]. These decks are vast, lined with burnished brass railings and adorned with intricately designed brasswork, blending form and function. The openness gives a sense of freedom but also danger, as the crew is always aware of the vastness of the [[Shift]] surrounding them.

The body of the ship is crafted from a burnished, glowing metal called [[Orichalcum]]- brass-like but imbued with a lustre that makes it seem otherworldly. Etched into its surface are intricate designs, like old nautical maps or celestial charts, that reflect the ship's journey through different realms. The hull's texture is smooth but complex, with rivets and ornamentation that give it a sturdy yet elegant look.

Inside, the engine room, often called "The Heart", is a place of arcane and brass mechanics, with glowing crystalline cores powering the ship. Here, giant brass gears and conduits pulse with shifting energies, linking the ship to the currents outside. Engineers tend to these systems, using knowledge both mechanical and mystical to maintain balance. The Heart pulses as if alive, because it *is* alive.

The crew’s quarters are more functional but still reflect the aesthetic, with brass inlays, hammocks hanging beneath exposed support beams, and soft, ambient light from crystalline lamps. These spaces are practical yet comfortable, as the crew spends long periods aboard the ship.

Shiftships are composed of [[volitive matter]] and can mold their shape and purpose to suit the whims of their crew as well as the dominant [[Reality Meme (Onton)|Ontons]] of a new world. The idea that a Shiftship could abandon travel and anchor itself in a forgotten pocket dimension is [[Malperdys|unthinkable]].
