Volitive matter is a substance with an inherent tendency to respond. Unlike passive material, it does not simply endure pressure; it chooses *how* to yield. Thought, intent, or even unconscious impulse leaves impressions in it. This makes it both incredibly useful and faintly dangerous, since it blurs the line between object and subject.
# [[Orichalcum]]
The most common form, prized among [[Irisian|Irisians]], is orichalcum: a coppery-golden alloy that resonates with thought. It can be hammered into shape with mundane tools, but just as easily bent by mental discipline. A smith with skill in meditation can forge a blade without ever lifting a hammer, provided their concentration is perfect. In practice, both craft and thought are often combined: physical shaping to begin, volitive imprinting to refine.
# Principle
Where ordinary materials obey the craftsman’s hand, volitive matter obeys the craftsman’s purpose. To think, "a blade that cuts lies," is to begin the forging of such a blade; to wear a cloak, "that hides sorrow," is to have it darken when grief is near.
## Intent Becomes Architecture
### Clothing
Garments woven with orichalcum thread cling perfectly, shifting colour with the wearer’s mood, and resist tearing unless the wearer despairs. An [[Irisian]] noble might simply will, "garments of majesty," and the orichalcum threads array themselves in flowing, radiant folds.
### Weapons
Blades and hafts hold an impression of their owner's style; in the wielder's hand, they feel lighter or heavier as needed, but in another's hand they might refuse to cut cleanly. A duelist might picture victory over speed and the sword lengthens, grows heavier, each thrust slower but more decisive.
### Architecture
Doors that only open to a thought of welcome, chairs that shift subtly to match posture, lamps that brighten when one enters the room. A hall built for judgment develops an austere geometry, acoustics that carry every word, and light that seems to expose secrets.
### The House
As a macrocosm of this principle, the House of [[Malperdys]] is intent crystallized: corridors that lengthen when searched, rooms that open when forgotten, thresholds that manifest when needed.
# Limitations
Volitive matter remembers. Once strongly impressed, it resists change, carrying the echo of its first intent. A sword once forged to, "strike the faithless," may always draw itself toward betrayal.

Ambiguity produces instability. Vague or conflicting intent can result in contradictory forms; a weapon that refuses to be drawn, a chair that cannot decide whether to recline or restrain.

Collective intent is the most dangerous: in places where many wills press upon the same matter, it can fracture or spawn contradictions. This is why shared volitive cities often fail.
# Cultural Note
The ancient [[Irisian|Irisians]] excelled because their minds were disciplined enough to focus intention without conflict. When their descendants tried to repeat the feat without such discipline, the results were unstable artifacts, haunted halls, and malformed weapons that carried their owner’s flaws.
# Hazards
Volitive matter is impressionable. Objects left in the hands of the desperate, cruel, or deranged warp toward those states: clothing that constricts, blades that thirst, rooms that close in.

Once strongly imprinted, volitive matter resists change. A sword that, "remembers," slaughter may forever after lean toward violence.

> [!Note] In the House of [[Malperdys]]
> The House itself is said to be made of volitive matter in its highest form. Corridors adjust to the needs (or fears) of residents. Doors close against violence. Dressing rooms seem to know precisely what garb is required. This makes the House both sanctuary and trap, since intent itself becomes the architecture.
