# Technology
The physical laws of [[Brane|universes]] tend to be roughly similar, though not identical. For most, if there are significant changes in physical laws, the outcomes of life for instances are profoundly different. The similarities between universes are supported by [[Reality Meme (Onton)|Ontons]] - reality memes that travel between universes, influencing them.

The general rule is: if life can exist in a universe, then technology will function on the same (or similar) parameters.

Technology differs from [[Wonders|Wonders]] because the latter uses rules which are unknown and perhaps undefined; Technology is limited to what is understood. 

Technology includes everything from

[[Apex Root]]

[[Black Spindle]]
[[Chronis Mechanism]]
[[Fliers]]
[[Lament Pillars]]
[[Myr]]
[[Radium Rifles|Radium guns]]
[[Shiftship|Shiftships]]
[[Sothothian Gate Spheres]]
[[Thern diadem]]
