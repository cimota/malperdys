Experimental Apparatus — [[Ontonic Objects|Ontonic Device]]
# Description
A brass-and-copper lattice bristling with coils, humming tubes, and violet-glass lenses. When activated, the Resonator vibrates the pineal gland of any nearby organism, overlaying the material world with higher-dimensional strata. To the operator, the air grows thick, colors shimmer unnaturally, and alien geometries swim into view. To the beings who dwell there, the operator is suddenly visible.
# Effect (Game Terms):
**Activation**: Failure produces noise, heat, and immediate unwanted attention.
> [!Note]- Rules
>  Roll for INT/Tech (or equivalent. 

**Perception**: While active, the user sees entities and structures normally hidden.
> [!Note]- Rules
>  Gain +2 dice on Investigation involving anomalies, but also suffer +1 Despair/Stress each scene.

**Exposure**: Anyone within 10 meters is likewise “attuned” and can be perceived by nearby extradimensional creatures. GM rolls secretly each scene to determine if contact occurs.
**Duration**: Each activation lasts 1d6 minutes before overheating. Cooling requires 1 hour.

Risks & Complications:

On a "Fumble" while operating: the Resonator’s hum intensifies, tearing a thin spot in reality — allowing something through.
Long-term exposure alters physiology (mutations, heightened senses, or madness), chosen by GM.

Hooks:

- A prototype was confiscated by a Ministry archive, but its blueprints have leaked onto the black market.
- A Resonator gone haywire has filled an entire district with overlapping nightmare realities.
- A cult considers the Resonator a sacred gateway, using it to commune with “the Hungry Ones Between.”
