Gate Spheres are the most convenient way to travel between realities. The [[Technology and Reality|technology]] to create them has been lost to time, but they were created.

Sothothian Gate Spheres are unstable, semi-physical constructs of fractured causality, each one a locus of passage between realities. These silvered, glass-like orbs are neither solid nor void but exist in superposition, shifting between potential states of being. They do not open like doors, nor activate like machines; instead, they must be understood. A mind that grasps the impossible geometries contained within their reflections can step through them, but the cost of passage is often unknown until it has already been paid. The [[Tindalean Lords]] record that the first Gate Spheres were plucked from the dying remnants of a universe devoured by Finality, crystallized echoes of its last remaining transit points, now repurposed as tools of power and peril.

To those uninitiated, a Sothothian Gate Sphere appears inert, a spherical mirror swallowing all light. But to those attuned, it is a maelstrom of shifting paths, a tangled convergence of possible routes between dimensions. A traveler must not merely look at the Sphere—they must listen. It does not hum, it does not vibrate, but it imposes its presence upon the mind, pressing alien whispers and half-seen visions into the skull like an ancient riddle demanding an answer. The routes it offers are not chosen but negotiated—and what lies on the other side is not always the same as when the journey began. To use a Sothothian Gate Sphere is to step into uncertainty, to embrace the logic of something that does not belong to this universe and yet governs the spaces between.

Some believe the Gate Spheres are alive—or worse, aware. They do not exist within a single timeline but seem to recognize those who have passed through them before, even across different iterations of existence. Some travelers return to find a Sphere waiting for them in a place it should not be, as if it has chosen them. The [[Tindalean Lords]] keep Sothothian Gate Spheres locked away, buried deep, or hidden within the folds of lost realities. Yet some remain untamed, unguarded, lost among the ruins of forgotten places, waiting for the right mind to gaze into them, to step forward, and to be taken.
# Using a Gate Sphere
Many gate spheres can be used by anyone who touches it and has sufficient presence of mind to will a gate to open. It will then transport anything within a 5 metre radius to the desired location, often swapping the atoms and molecules bit for bit. However that is not their primary use. If attuned to a Gate Sphere, the touch is no longer needed and the Gate Sphere will automatically expand to the desired size and take the travellers to the desired destination. The Gate Sphere may appear like a spherical portal, which, upon entering will deposit the traveller at their destination.
