Drift is the effect of all of the combined forces on an individual. We are all subject to it.

*As a simple analogy, you move to a new country and quickly find that your accent is changing, perhaps the foods you now eat has changed, even the water is different. You have a new person to cut your hair so your hairstyle changes and you can’t get the same brand names so your clothes are different. Within a few years all of your cells have been replaced with cells made from the stuff in your new home, so are you even the same person any more?*

Drift extinguishes [[Echo|Echoes]] first.

*Game thought idea: Drift is like a random event in the game. Maybe brought on the winds, but it serves to temporarily decrease or disable “multiverse abilities”. Leading to the players not being able to do what they thought they could do and having to find a way to recharge them.*
