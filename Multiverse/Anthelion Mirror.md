In 1942, as part of a desperate experiment, Allied scientists opened a dimensional lens—what they found was another Earth, twenty minutes ahead, visible but unreachable. 

The phenomenon came to be called the **Anthelion Mirror**, and over the decades, more reflections emerged: Earths five hours ahead, one day, a week. 

By 2020, twenty-seven Earths were known, each at a different temporal offset, each visible from carefully calibrated locations using lens technology. 

A fragile diplomatic order—the **Anthelion Pact**—was established to prevent paradox and preserve cross-temporal stability. 

But smuggling between timelines is rampant. Assassins leap from the future. Some Pacts want unification. Others want extermination of the timelines behind them.

These Earths display little [[Drift]] and seem to be ontologically paired with substantial [[Reality Meme (Onton)|Onton]] replication.
