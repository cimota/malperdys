# Apeiron
The infinite, the unbounded — evokes the endlessness of the [[Shift]], but maybe this is the term for all of the worlds. Instead of saying, "multiverse".
# Arkhe
Simple, elemental, suggests first cause, primal order. I think we keep this as a place somewhere in the shift.
# Chōra
Plato's, "receptacle," of becoming; the space between worlds. In Plato's description, the Forms leave, "traces," or, "impressions," in the Chōra - but these are always unstable, like reflections in water. That explains why universes might bleed into each other, or why cargoes ([[Reality Meme (Onton)|Ontons]], relics, beings) are warped when carried across.
# [[Darkness]]
[[Darkness]] is the agreed term for describing forces which exist outside of a universal brane but exact influence within the [[Brane]]. Variously called Dark Matter, Dark Energy over the centuries on [[Earth]], the [[Darkness]] is not something that can be defined from within; only by viewing the influence from the [[Shift|Bulk]] (the space between worlds) can it be defined. See [[Darkness]].
# [[Magic]]
# Finality
The term suggests more than just destruction—it implies an inversion, an unraveling, or even a fundamental overturning of reality itself. "Finality," would signify a complete flipping or undoing of existence. Saying that a reality has been Finalised carries the implication that it has not merely ceased but has been undone in a way that might leave no trace—or perhaps a dangerous void where it once was. See [[Finalised Universes|Universes Which Have Been Finalised]]. Only once a reality has been Finalised will [[Darkness]] be no longer felt.
 > - *The finality of that realm is absolute.*
# Incursion
A rewriting of a part of a reality by another intruding reality. This usually involves advanced [[Technology and Reality]] or [[Wonders]]. The most common technology used is [[Sothothian Gate Spheres|Sothothian Gate Technology]].
# [[Reality Meme (Onton)]]
# Reversion
The traveller between worlds may have an emergency escape that leaves a tell-tale rupture in the fabric of the universe, but gives them an escape. This is not to be used lightly as the tell-tale can be followed.
 > - *She initiated reversion, tearing a path home.*
# Time
The sequence of time period, increasing in scale, are as follows:
> 1. Decades (10 years)
> 2. Centuries (100 years)
> 3. Millennia (1,000 years)
> 4. Eons (several hundred million to a billion years)
> 5. Kalpas (Hindu/Buddhist concept, often billions of years, a full cycle of creation and destruction)
> 6. Chrono-Lapsarian Epochs (a term for multi-universal time collapses or shifts)
> 7. Finalities (if we consider the end of all time as a measurable concept)
