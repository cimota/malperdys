To be unanchored is to be potentially lost within the multiverse. This state is most often held by persons or objects which have been orphaned from their home reality; most commonly [[Refugees]] but they may also be [[Technology and Reality|technology]] or wondrous artefacts.

As a result, the unique qualities from their home reality (their [[Echo|echoes]]) begin to fade.
