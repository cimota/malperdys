A discrete universal dimension with its own set of rules. This universe may be vast (like the source-hypervolume associated with the [[Irisian|Irisians]]) or it may be small (like the universe associated with [[Earth]]) or even tiny (like the [[Balnibarbi]] and [[Malperdys]] pockets).

Branes may be physically or semantically adjacent, permitting the interference of [[Darkness]] between them. This process permits the transfer of [[Reality Meme (Onton)|Ontons]], reality-influencing concepts which steer universes towards parallel or convergent development.

Branes “float” inside the [[Shift|Bulk]] (another name for the Shift) and are subject to the [[Aethyric Winds]] which may move their position in relation to other universes (this can be physically or semantically - limiting the influence of their [[Reality Meme (Onton)|Ontons]].)
# Semanticity
While there are potentially billions of each reality, the semantic differences between realities start to amalgamate them. It might be helpful to think of two semantically similar [[Shift|Bulk]] spaces as physically adjacent or even overlapping. The [[Reality Meme (Onton)|ontons]] are able to pass between them easily, subtly influencing each reality. 

For example. 

Two Earth realities which have very small differences can create a phenomena such as ***The Mandela Effect***, a manifestation of false memories implanted by ontons between the two places or ***Deja Vu***, the feeling of familiarity with new experiences. Some conditions (schizophrenia, autism) may include heightened perceptions of these semantically adjacent realities.
