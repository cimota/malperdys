When talking about physics, particularly in quantum mechanics, certain behaviours of atoms and particles are often described as, "spooky," (as in Einstein's, "spooky action at a distance") or, "magic," due to their counterintuitive, almost supernatural qualities.

In MALPERDYS, Darkness is not mere absence of light—it is the influence of things that do not belong to our universe, exerting unseen pressure upon reality. It is the signature of entities, energy, and structures beyond our ontological frame of reference, bending and warping our world while remaining forever beyond reach for most of us.

Darkness is not a thing but an effect—a reminder that we exist within a bounded reality, and something else is just beyond it, pressing in, shifting the weight of our universe ever so slightly toward an unknown end.

# Abyssal Superposition
A thing touched by Darkness may exist in multiple states at once, seen or unseen, present or lost, its true nature only revealed when observed directly.
# Chrono-Lapsarian Dissonance
Darkness skews causality, making the past unstable and the future uncertain. A thing’s state may be rewritten by its own shadow.
# Horizon Bleeding
At the event horizon of a black hole, Darkness seeps through, thinning the boundaries between universes. What escapes is not what was consumed.
# Non-Local Influence
Events across vast distances are connected by the unseen currents of Darkness, affecting each other with no physical link.
# Zero-Point Void
Even where there is nothing, Darkness remains—a residue of forces not of this universe, acting upon our world without form.
