Abyssal Minds is a **Weirdness of the Week** idea. 

“you come to the office, you work your day and then you…go to sleep. Only to wake and do the same thing again. Every day”

“The work doesn’t seem to be achieving anything but there’s always plenty of it.”

Premise:

1. Make characters who have somewhat blank slate personalities. 
2. Get them to have a photo of their person.
3. Write up a description of that person outside work.
4. Make the players perform surreal and horrifying acts
5. At the end of the work day, give them their new character sheets
	1. the skills are the same
	2. The picture is different
	3. The players are dissociated from the work identity

(Heavily inspired by The Backrooms, the TV series “Severance”, the TTRPG Zero, the movie Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle)
