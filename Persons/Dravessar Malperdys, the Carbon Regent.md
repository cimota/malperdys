# Lineage
Scion of the [[Shadow Line]], believed lost centuries ago during a failed passage of [[Malperdys#The Serpent Crossing|the Serpent Crossing]].
# Appearance
A tall, skeletal figure clad in robes that shimmer like smoke over glass. His skin is marbled black, brittle as coal, yet unbroken. His eyes gleam with faint red light, like embers trapped in crystal. When he moves, flakes of carbon drift from his body, leaving a trace of ash in his wake.
# Origins
Dravessar sought to master the [[Gorgon|Gorgon's]] gaze, to turn petrification into an instrument of dominion. When his expedition into the [[Shift]] collapsed, the House assumed him shattered like the rest. Instead, he endured, half flesh, half brittle carbon, locked in a state of eternal fracture. He calls himself Regent because he claims the true heirs of [[Malperdys]] are weak, and only through fixation, turning all possibility into singular certainty, can dominion endure.
# Motives
- To bind worlds into carbon stillness, creating a multiverse of statues, perfectly ordered and unchanging.
- To replace the [[Malperdys|House's]] recursive time with a singular line: his own rule, unbroken.
- To hunt surviving scions, so their fractured lineages end in him.
# Powers
## Petrifying Gaze
Victims turn to brittle carbon, shattering if struck. Dravessar can choose to make this partial, freezing a limb or feature. This is a slightly weaker version of the [[Gorgon]] ability to remove entropic energy from the target, petrifying it.
## Ashbound Presence
The air around him dries and cracks; torches gutter, lungs ache. Each round in his presence inflicts cumulative fatigue.
## [[Onton|Ontonic]] Fixation
Once per encounter, he can declare an action or event irreversible. No rerolls, no rescues, no do-overs. The moment becomes fixed.
## Immortality of Fracture
He cannot be killed by conventional means. When struck down, his carbonized body breaks apart, only to reassemble over time. To destroy him requires dispersing him within the [[Shift]].
# Weakness
His fractured state means he is brittle. Heavy impacts, vibrations, or resonant [[Onton|ontonic]] frequencies can crack him.

Mirrors and reflections unsettle him, not because they turn his gaze back, but because they remind him of the many selves he lost to his own fixation.
# In Play
As a recurring villain, he is terrifying in person but more dangerous through agents: Collectors and petrified thralls.

His signature is always the same: a trail of brittle carbon statues, perfectly lifelike, forever screaming.

The final confrontation might not be in battle, but in a contest of wills, can the [[Malperdys#Households|Household]] keep their possibilities open when he tries to collapse them into stillness?
