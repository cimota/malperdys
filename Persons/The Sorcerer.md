Oscar Diggs was born in Omaha, Nebraska on [[Earth]] in the late 18th Century. He grew up poor and by his late teens had been working as a grifter and amateur magician at a travelling circus. It is believed his hot air balloon was caught in a [[Shift-storm]] and found its way through the [[Shift]] to [[The Emerald City]]. He usurped the throne from the sitting regent and set himself up as the ruler and grand vizier. The rightful ruler, an infant girl, was secretly spirited away by [[Mombi of the North]].

The Sorcerer purports to employ [[Wonders|magic]], but really uses advanced [[Technology and Reality|technology]] (equivalent to early 20th Century Earth) compared to the pre-industrial inhabitants of the land known as Oz. He has also spent time trading and seeking other [[Wonders]] to help cement his rule.

He was opposed in his efforts by the Witches: [[Mombi of the North]], [[Witch of the East]], [[Bastinda of the West]] and [[Witch of the South]] though all were ultimately defeated and either exiled or killed. He has retained their [[Wonders]] as part of his arsenal.
